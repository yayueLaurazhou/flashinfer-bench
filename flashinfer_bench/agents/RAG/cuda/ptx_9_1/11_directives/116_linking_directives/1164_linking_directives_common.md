Description

Declares identifier to be globally visible but “common”.

Common symbols are similar to globally visible symbols. However multiple object files may declare
the same common symbol and they may have different types and sizes and references to a symbol get
resolved against a common symbol with the largest size.

Only one object file can initialize a common symbol and that must have the largest size among all
other definitions of that common symbol from different object files.

`.common` linking directive can be used only on variables with `.global` storage. It cannot be
used on function symbols or on symbols with opaque type.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 5.0.

Target ISA Notes

`.common` directive requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples
