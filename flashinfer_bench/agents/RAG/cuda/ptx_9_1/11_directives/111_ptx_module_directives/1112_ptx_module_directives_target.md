Description

Specifies the set of features in the target architecture for which the current PTX code was
generated. In general, generations of SM architectures follow an *onion layer* model, where each
generation adds new features and retains all features of previous generations. The onion layer model
allows the PTX code generated for a given target to be run on later generation devices.

Target architectures with suffix “`a`”, such as `sm_90a`, include architecture-specific
features that are supported on the specified architecture only, hence such targets do not follow the
onion layer model. Therefore, PTX code generated for such targets cannot be run on later generation
devices. Architecture-specific features can only be used with targets that support these
features.

Target architectures with suffix “`f`”, such as `sm_100f`, include family-specific features that
are supported only within the same architecture family. Therefore, PTX code generated for such
targets can run only on later generation devices in the same family. Family-specific features can be
used with f-targets as well as a-targets of later generation devices in the same family.

[Table 58](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#architecture-family-definition) defines the architecture families.

Table 58 Architecture Families[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#architecture-family-definition "Permalink to this table")




| Family | Target SM architectures included |
| --- | --- |
| sm\_10x family | sm\_100f, sm\_103f, future targets in sm\_10x family |
| sm\_11x family | sm\_110f, sm\_101f, future targets in sm\_11x family |
| sm\_12x family | sm\_120f, sm\_121f, future targets in sm\_12x family |

Semantics

Each PTX module must begin with a `.version` directive, immediately followed by a `.target`
directive containing a target architecture and optional platform options. A `.target` directive
specifies a single target architecture, but subsequent `.target` directives can be used to change
the set of target features allowed during parsing. A program with multiple `.target` directives
will compile and run only on devices that support all features of the highest-numbered architecture
listed in the program.

PTX features are checked against the specified target architecture, and an error is generated if an
unsupported feature is used. The following table summarizes the features in PTX that vary according
to target architecture.

The texturing mode is specified for an entire module and cannot be changed within the module.

The `.target` debug option declares that the PTX file contains DWARF debug information, and
subsequent compilation of PTX will retain information needed for source-level debugging. If the
debug option is declared, an error message is generated if no DWARF information is found in the
file. The debug option requires PTX ISA version 3.0 or later.

`map_f64_to_f32` indicates that all double-precision instructions map to single-precision
regardless of the target architecture. This enables high-level language compilers to compile
programs containing type double to target device that do not support double-precision
operations. Note that `.f64` storage remains as 64-bits, with only half being used by instructions
converted from `.f64` to `.f32`.

Notes

Targets of the form `compute_xx` are also accepted as synonyms for `sm_xx` targets.

Targets `sm_{101,101f,101a}` are renamed to targets `sm_{110,110f,110a}` from PTX ISA version 9.0.
