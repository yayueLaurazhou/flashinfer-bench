# 11.4. Performance-Tuning Directives

## 11.4. [Performance-Tuning Directives](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives "Permalink to this headline")

To provide a mechanism for low-level performance tuning, PTX supports the following directives,
which pass information to the optimizing backend compiler.

* `.maxnreg`
* `.maxntid`
* `.reqntid`
* `.minnctapersm`
* `.maxnctapersm` (deprecated)
* `.pragma`
* `.abi_preserve`
* `.abi_preserve_control`

The `.maxnreg` directive specifies the maximum number of registers to be allocated to a single
thread;
the `.maxntid` directive specifies the maximum number of threads
in a thread block (CTA); the `.reqntid` directive specifies the required number of threads in a
thread block (CTA); and the `.minnctapersm` directive specifies a minimum number of thread blocks
to be scheduled on a single multiprocessor (SM). These can be used, for example, to throttle the
resource requirements (e.g., registers) to increase total thread count and provide a greater
opportunity to hide memory latency. The `.minnctapersm` directive can be used together with either
the `.maxntid` or `.reqntid` directive to trade-off registers-per-thread against multiprocessor
utilization without needed to directly specify a maximum number of registers. This may achieve better
performance when compiling PTX for multiple devices having different numbers of registers per SM.

Device function directives `.abi_preserve` and `.abi_preserve_control` specify number of data
and control registers from callee save registers that a function must preserve for its caller. This
can be considered to be the number of general purpose and control registers live in the caller when function
is called. Control registers refer to the number of divergent program points that happen in the calltree
leading to current function call.

Currently, the `.maxnreg`,
`.maxntid`, `.reqntid`, and `.minnctapersm`
directives may be applied per-entry and must appear between an `.entry` directive and its body.
The directives take precedence over any module-level constraints passed to the optimizing backend.
A warning message is generated if the directives’ constraints are inconsistent or cannot be met for
the specified target device.

A general `.pragma` directive is supported for passing information to the PTX backend. The
directive passes a list of strings to the backend, and the strings have no semantics within the PTX
virtual machine model. The interpretation of `.pragma` values is determined by the backend
implementation and is beyond the scope of the PTX ISA. Note that `.pragma` directives may appear
at module (file) scope, at entry-scope, or as statements within a kernel or device function body.
