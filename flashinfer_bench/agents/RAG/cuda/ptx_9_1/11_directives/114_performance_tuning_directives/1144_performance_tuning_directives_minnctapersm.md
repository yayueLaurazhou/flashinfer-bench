# 11.4.4. Performance-Tuning Directives: .minnctapersm

### 11.4.4. [Performance-Tuning Directives: `.minnctapersm`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives-minnctapersm)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives-minnctapersm "Permalink to this headline")

`.minnctapersm`

Minimum number of CTAs per SM.

Syntax

```
.minnctapersm ncta
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Declare the minimum number of CTAs from the kernel’s grid to be mapped to a single multiprocessor
(SM).

Notes

Optimizations based on `.minnctapersm` need either `.maxntid` or `.reqntid` to be specified as
well.

If the total number of threads on a single SM resulting from `.minnctapersm` and `.maxntid` /
`.reqntid` exceed maximum number of threads supported by an SM then directive `.minnctapersm`
will be ignored.

In PTX ISA version 2.1 or higher, a warning is generated if `.minnctapersm` is specified without
specifying either `.maxntid` or `.reqntid`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0 as a replacement for `.maxnctapersm`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
.entry foo .maxntid 256 .minnctapersm 4 { ... }
```
