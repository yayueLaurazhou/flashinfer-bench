# 11.4.5. Performance-Tuning Directives: .maxnctapersm (deprecated)

### 11.4.5. [Performance-Tuning Directives: `.maxnctapersm` (deprecated)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives-maxnctapersm)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#performance-tuning-directives-maxnctapersm "Permalink to this headline")

`.maxnctapersm`

Maximum number of CTAs per SM.

Syntax

```
.maxnctapersm ncta
```

Copy to clipboard

Description

Declare the maximum number of CTAs from the kernel’s grid that may be mapped to a single
multiprocessor (SM).

Notes

Optimizations based on .maxnctapersm generally need `.maxntid` to be specified as well. The
optimizing backend compiler uses `.maxntid` and `.maxnctapersm` to compute an upper-bound on
per-thread register usage so that the specified number of CTAs can be mapped to a single
multiprocessor. However, if the number of registers used by the backend is sufficiently lower than
this bound, additional CTAs may be mapped to a single multiprocessor. For this reason,
`.maxnctapersm` has been renamed to .minnctapersm in PTX ISA version 2.0.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.3. Deprecated in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
.entry foo .maxntid 256 .maxnctapersm 4 { ... }
