        "description": "# 1. Introduction\n\nThis section introduces PTX as a low-level parallel thread execution virtual machine and instruction set architecture (ISA). It covers the goals of PTX in enabling scalable data-parallel computing, the evolution of the GPU as a many-core processor, and the document structure. It also details the new features in PTX ISA Version 9.1, such as support for the `volatile` qualifier on local state space and new floating-point format conversions."

        "name": "2_programming_model",
        "description": "# 2. Programming Model\n\nThis section defines the PTX programming model, focusing on the thread hierarchy and memory hierarchy. It explains Cooperative Thread Arrays (CTAs), the new Cluster level (groups of CTAs introduced in sm_90), and Grids. It details how threads are organized into warps and how they can synchronize and communicate via shared memory and barriers. It also outlines the memory hierarchy, including global, shared, local, constant, texture, and parameter state spaces."

PTX Machine Model\n\nThis section describes the underlying machine model, including the array of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and the SIMT (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread) architecture. It covers Independent Thread Scheduling (introduced in Volta), which allows full concurrency between threads, and details the on-chip memory resources such as registers, shared memory, and caches (constant, texture, L1/L2)."

        "name": "4_syntax",
        "description": "# 4. Syntax\n\nThis section specifies the syntax of the PTX language. It covers source format rules, comment styles, and the structure of statements (directives and instructions). It defines the rules for user-defined identifiers and detailed syntax for constants, including integer, floating-point (standard and alternate formats), predicate constants, and constant expression evaluation rules."

State Spaces, Types, and Variables\n\nThis section enumerates the PTX state spaces (`.reg`, `.global`, `.shared`, `.local`, `.const`, `.param`, etc.) and their properties. It defines the fundamental data types (integer, floating-point, bit-size, predicate) and alternate data formats (e.g., `bf16`, `tf32`, `e4m3`, `e5m2`). It also covers variable declarations, initializers, alignment, vector types, array declarations, and extensive details on Tensor data structures and access modes (Tiled and Im2col)."

It details operand type checking, source and destination operand rules, and the use of addresses, arrays, vectors, labels, and function names as operands. It also explains type conversion rules between different data sizes and formats, and provides cost estimates for accessing different state spaces."

It covers function declarations and definitions (`.func`, `.entry`), parameter passing conventions using the `.param` state space, and stack manipulation using instructions like `alloca` for dynamic stack allocation."

It specifies the ordering constraints on memory operations (program order, observation order), memory synchronization, scope (CTA, Cluster, GPU, System), and atomicity. It details concepts like Acquire/Release patterns, fence operations (`fence.sc`, `fence.acq_rel`), and causality."

It includes integer and floating-point arithmetic (including half-precision and matrix multiply-accumulate `mma`/`wmma`), comparison and selection, logic and shift, and data movement instructions (`ld`, `st`, `cp.async`, `tensormap`). It also covers texture and surface instructions, control flow (`bra`, `call`), synchronization (`bar`, `mbarrier`), and miscellaneous instructions."
