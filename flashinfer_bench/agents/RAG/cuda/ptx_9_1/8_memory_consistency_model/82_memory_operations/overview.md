The fundamental storage unit in the PTX memory model is a byte, consisting of 8 bits. Each state
space available to a PTX program is a sequence of contiguous bytes in memory. Every byte in a PTX
state space has a unique address relative to all threads that have access to the same state space.

Each PTX memory instruction specifies an address operand and a data type. The address operand
contains a virtual address that gets converted to a physical address during memory access. The
physical address and the size of the data type together define a physical memory location, which is
the range of bytes starting from the physical address and extending up to the size of the data type
in bytes.

The memory consistency model specification uses the terms “address” or “memory address” to indicate
a virtual address, and the term “memory location” to indicate a physical memory location.

Each PTX memory instruction also specifies the operation — either a read, a write or an atomic
read-modify-write — to be performed on all the bytes in the corresponding memory location.
