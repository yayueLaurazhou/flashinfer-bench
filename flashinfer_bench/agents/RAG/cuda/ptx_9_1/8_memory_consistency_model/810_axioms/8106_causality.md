# 8.10.6. Causality

### 8.10.6. [Causality](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#causality-axiom)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#causality-axiom "Permalink to this headline")

Relations in *communication order* cannot contradict *causality order*. This constrains the set of
candidate write operations that a read operation may read from:

1. If a read R precedes an *overlapping* write W in *causality order*, then R cannot read from W.
2. If a write W precedes an *overlapping* read R in *causality order*, then for any byte accessed by
   both R and W, R cannot read from any write W’ that precedes W in *coherence order*.

Litmus Test: Message Passing

| --- | --- |
| ``` .global .u32 data = 0; .global .u32 flag = 0; ```  Copy to clipboard | |
| T1 | T2 |
| ``` W1: st.global.u32 [data], 1; F1: fence.sys; W2: st.global.relaxed.sys.u32 [flag], 1; ```  Copy to clipboard | ``` R1: ld.global.relaxed.sys.u32 %r0, [flag]; F2: fence.sys; R2: ld.global.u32 %r1, [data]; ```  Copy to clipboard |
| ``` IF %r0 == 1 THEN %r1 == 1 ```  Copy to clipboard | |

The litmus test known as “MP” (Message Passing) represents the essence of typical synchronization
algorithms. A vast majority of useful programs can be reduced to sequenced applications of this
pattern.

Thread T1 first writes to a data variable and then to a flag variable while a second thread T2 first
reads from the flag variable and then from the data variable. The operations on the flag are
*morally strong* and the memory operations in each thread are separated by a *fence*, and these
*fences* are *morally strong*.

If R1 observes W2, then the release pattern “F1; W2” *synchronizes* with the *acquire pattern* “R1;
F2”. This establishes the *causality order* W1 -> F1 -> W2 -> R1 -> F2 -> R2. Then axiom *causality*
guarantees that R2 cannot read from any write that precedes W1 in *coherence order*. In the absence
of any other writes in this example, R2 must read from W1.

Litmus Test: CoWR

| ``` // These addresses are aliases .global .u32 data_alias_1; .global .u32 data_alias_2; ```  Copy to clipboard |
| T1 |
| ``` W1: st.global.u32 [data_alias_1], 1; F1: fence.proxy.alias; R1: ld.global.u32 %r1, [data_alias_2]; ```  Copy to clipboard |
| ``` %r1 == 1 ```  Copy to clipboard |

Virtual aliases require an alias *proxy fence* along the synchronization path.

Litmus Test: Store Buffering

The litmus test known as “SB” (Store Buffering) demonstrates the *sequential consistency* enforced
by the `fence.sc`. A thread T1 writes to a first variable, and then reads the value of a second
variable, while a second thread T2 writes to the second variable and then reads the value of the
first variable. The memory operations in each thread are separated by `fence.`sc instructions,
and these *fences* are *morally strong*.

| T1 | T2 |
| ``` W1: st.global.u32 [x], 1; F1: fence.sc.sys; R1: ld.global.u32 %r0, [y]; ```  Copy to clipboard | ``` W2: st.global.u32 [y], 1; F2: fence.sc.sys; R2: ld.global.u32 %r1, [x]; ```  Copy to clipboard |

In any execution, either F1 precedes F2 in *Fence-SC* order, or vice versa. If F1 precedes F2 in
*Fence-SC* order, then F1 *synchronizes* with F2. This establishes the *causality order* in W1 -> F1
-> F2 -> R2. Axiom *causality* ensures that R2 cannot read from any write that precedes W1 in
*coherence order*. In the absence of any other write to that variable, R2 must read from
W1. Similarly, in the case where F2 precedes F1 in *Fence-SC* order, R1 must read from W2. If each
`fence.sc` in this example were replaced by a `fence.acq_rel` instruction, then this outcome is
not guaranteed. There may be an execution where the write from each thread remains unobserved from
the other thread, i.e., an execution is possible, where both R1 and R2 return the initial value “0”
for variables y and x respectively.
