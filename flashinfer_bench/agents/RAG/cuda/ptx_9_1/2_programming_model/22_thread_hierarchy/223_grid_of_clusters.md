# 2.2.3. Grid of Clusters

### 2.2.3. [Grid of Clusters](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#grid-of-clusters)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#grid-of-clusters "Permalink to this headline")

There is a maximum number of threads that a CTA can contain and a maximum number of CTAs that a
cluster can contain. However, clusters with CTAs that execute the same kernel can be batched
together into a grid of clusters, so that the total number of threads that can be launched in a
single kernel invocation is very large. This comes at the expense of reduced thread communication
and synchronization, because threads in different clusters cannot communicate and synchronize with
each other.

Each cluster has a unique cluster identifier (*clusterid*) within a grid of clusters. Each grid of
clusters has a 1D, 2D , or 3D shape specified by the parameter *nclusterid*. Each grid also has a
unique temporal grid identifier (*gridid*). Threads may read and use these values through
predefined, read-only special registers `%tid`, `%ntid`, `%clusterid`, `%nclusterid`, and
`%gridid`.

Each CTA has a unique identifier (*ctaid*) within a grid. Each grid of CTAs has 1D, 2D, or 3D shape
specified by the parameter *nctaid*. Thread may use and read these values through predefined,
read-only special registers `%ctaid` and `%nctaid`.

Each kernel is executed as a batch of threads organized as a grid of clusters consisting of CTAs
where cluster is optional level and is applicable only for target architectures `sm_90` and
higher. [Figure 1](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#grid-of-clusters-grid-with-ctas) shows a grid consisting of CTAs and
[Figure 2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#grid-of-clusters-grid-with-clusters) shows a grid consisting of clusters.

Grids may be launched with dependencies between one another - a grid may be a dependent grid and/or
a prerequisite grid. To understand how grid dependencies may be defined, refer to the section on
*CUDA Graphs* in the *Cuda Programming Guide*.

A cluster is a set of cooperative thread arrays (CTAs) where a CTA is a set of concurrent threads
that execute the same kernel program. A grid is a set of clusters consisting of CTAs that
execute independently.
