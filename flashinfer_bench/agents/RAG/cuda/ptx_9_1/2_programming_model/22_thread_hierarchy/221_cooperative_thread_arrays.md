# 2.2.1. Cooperative Thread Arrays

### 2.2.1. [Cooperative Thread Arrays](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#cooperative-thread-arrays)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#cooperative-thread-arrays "Permalink to this headline")

The *Parallel Thread Execution (PTX)* programming model is explicitly parallel: a PTX program
specifies the execution of a given thread of a parallel thread array. A *cooperative thread array*,
or CTA, is an array of threads that execute a kernel concurrently or in parallel.

Threads within a CTA can communicate with each other. To coordinate the communication of the threads
within the CTA, one can specify synchronization points where threads wait until all threads in the
CTA have arrived.

Each thread has a unique thread identifier within the CTA. Programs use a data parallel
decomposition to partition inputs, work, and results across the threads of the CTA. Each CTA thread
uses its thread identifier to determine its assigned role, assign specific input and output
positions, compute addresses, and select work to perform. The thread identifier is a three-element
vector `tid`, (with elements `tid.x`, `tid.y`, and `tid.z`) that specifies the thread’s
position within a 1D, 2D, or 3D CTA. Each thread identifier component ranges from zero up to the
number of thread ids in that CTA dimension.

Each CTA has a 1D, 2D, or 3D shape specified by a three-element vector `ntid` (with elements
`ntid.x`, `ntid.y`, and `ntid.z`). The vector `ntid` specifies the number of threads in each
CTA dimension.

Threads within a CTA execute in SIMT (single-instruction, multiple-thread) fashion in groups called
*warps*. A *warp* is a maximal subset of threads from a single CTA, such that the threads execute
the same instructions at the same time. Threads within a warp are sequentially numbered. The warp
size is a machine-dependent constant. Typically, a warp has 32 threads. Some applications may be
able to maximize performance with knowledge of the warp size, so PTX includes a run-time immediate
constant, `WARP_SZ`, which may be used in any instruction where an immediate operand is allowed.
