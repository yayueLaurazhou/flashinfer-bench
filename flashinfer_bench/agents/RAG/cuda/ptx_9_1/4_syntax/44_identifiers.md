# 4.4. Identifiers

## 4.4. [Identifiers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#identifiers)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#identifiers "Permalink to this headline")

User-defined identifiers follow extended C++ rules: they either start with a letter followed by zero
or more letters, digits, underscore, or dollar characters; or they start with an underscore, dollar,
or percentage character followed by one or more letters, digits, underscore, or dollar characters:

```
followsym:   [a-zA-Z0-9_$]
identifier:  [a-zA-Z]{followsym}* | {[_$%]{followsym}+
```

PTX does not specify a maximum length for identifiers and suggests that all implementations support
a minimum length of at least 1024 characters.

Many high-level languages such as C and C++ follow similar rules for identifier names, except that
the percentage sign is not allowed. PTX allows the percentage sign as the first character of an
identifier. The percentage sign can be used to avoid name conflicts, e.g., between user-defined
variable names and compiler-generated names.

PTX predefines one constant and a small number of special registers that begin with the percentage
sign, listed in [Table 3](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#identifiers-predefined-identifiers).
