# 4.5.4. Constant Expressions

### 4.5.4. [Constant Expressions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#constant-expressions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#constant-expressions "Permalink to this headline")

In PTX, constant expressions are formed using operators as in C and are evaluated using rules
similar to those in C, but simplified by restricting types and sizes, removing most casts, and
defining full semantics to eliminate cases where expression evaluation in C is implementation
dependent.

Constant expressions are formed from constant literals, unary plus and minus, basic arithmetic
operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), comparison operators, the conditional
ternary operator ( `?:` ), and parentheses. Integer constant expressions also allow unary logical
negation (`!`), bitwise complement (`~`), remainder (`%`), shift operators (`<<` and
`>>`), bit-type operators (`&`, `|`, and `^`), and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).

Constant expressions in PTX do not support casts between integer and floating-point.

Constant expressions are evaluated using the same operator precedence as
in C. [Table 4](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#constant-expressions-operator-precedence) gives operator precedence and
associativity. Operator precedence is highest for unary operators and decreases with each line in
the chart. Operators on the same line have the same precedence and are evaluated right-to-left for
unary operators and left-to-right for binary operators.
