# 4.5.5. Integer Constant Expression Evaluation

### 4.5.5. [Integer Constant Expression Evaluation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-constant-expression-evaluation)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-constant-expression-evaluation "Permalink to this headline")

Integer constant expressions are evaluated at compile time according to a set of rules that
determine the type (signed `.s64` versus unsigned `.u64`) of each sub-expression. These rules
are based on the rules in C, but they’ve been simplified to apply only to 64-bit integers, and
behavior is fully defined in all cases (specifically, for remainder and shift operators).

* Literals are signed unless unsigned is needed to prevent overflow, or unless the literal uses a
  `U` suffix. For example:

  + `42`, `0x1234`, `0123` are signed.
  + `0xfabc123400000000`, `42U`, `0x1234U` are unsigned.
* Unary plus and minus preserve the type of the input operand. For example:

  + `+123`, `-1`, `-(-42)` are signed.
  + `-1U`, `-0xfabc123400000000` are unsigned.
* Unary logical negation (`!`) produces a signed result with value `0` or `1`.
* Unary bitwise complement (`~`) interprets the source operand as unsigned and produces an
  unsigned result.
* Some binary operators require normalization of source operands. This normalization is known as
  *the usual arithmetic conversions* and simply converts both operands to unsigned type if either
  operand is unsigned.
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division perform the usual arithmetic conversions and
  produce a result with the same type as the converted operands. That is, the operands and result
  are unsigned if either source operand is unsigned, and is otherwise signed.
* Remainder (`%`) interprets the operands as unsigned. Note that this differs from C, which allows
  a negative divisor but defines the behavior to be implementation dependent.
* Left and right shift interpret the second operand as unsigned and produce a result with the same
  type as the first operand. Note that the behavior of right-shift is determined by the type of the
  first operand: right shift of a signed value is arithmetic and preserves the sign, and right shift
  of an unsigned value is logical and shifts in a zero bit.
* AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) perform the usual arithmetic conversions and produce a
  result with the same type as the converted operands.
* AND\_OP (`&&`), OR\_OP (`||`), Equal (`==`), and Not\_Equal (`!=`) produce a signed
  result. The result value is 0 or 1.
* Ordered comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) perform the usual arithmetic conversions on
  source operands and produce a signed result. The result value is `0` or `1`.
* Casting of expressions to signed or unsigned is supported using (`.s64`) and (`.u64`) casts.
* For the conditional operator ( `? :` ) , the first operand must be an integer, and the second
  and third operands are either both integers or both floating-point. The usual arithmetic
  conversions are performed on the second and third operands, and the result type is the same as the
  converted type.
