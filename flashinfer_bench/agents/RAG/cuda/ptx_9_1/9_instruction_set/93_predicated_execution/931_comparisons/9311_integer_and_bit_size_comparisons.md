# 9.3.1.1. Integer and Bit-Size Comparisons

#### 9.3.1.1. [Integer and Bit-Size Comparisons](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons "Permalink to this headline")

The signed integer comparisons are the traditional `eq` (equal), `ne` (not-equal), `lt`
(less-than), `le` (less-than-or-equal), `gt` (greater-than), and `ge`
(greater-than-or-equal). The unsigned comparisons are `eq`, `ne`, `lo` (lower), `ls`
(lower-or-same), `hi` (higher), and `hs` (higher-or-same). The bit-size comparisons are `eq`
and `ne`; ordering comparisons are not defined for bit-size types.

[Table 22](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons-operators-for-signed-integer-unsigned-integer-and-bit-size-types)
shows the operators for signed integer, unsigned integer, and bit-size types.
