#### 9.7.8.6. [Logic and Shift Instructions: `lop3`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-lop3)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#logic-and-shift-instructions-lop3 "Permalink to this headline")

`lop3`

Arbitrary logical operation on 3 inputs.

Syntax

```
lop3.b32 d, a, b, c, immLut;
lop3.BoolOp.b32 d|p, a, b, c, immLut, q;

.BoolOp   = { .or , .and };
```

Description

Compute bitwise logical operation on inputs `a`, `b`, `c` and store the result in destination
`d`.

Optionally, `.BoolOp` can be specified to compute the predicate result `p` by performing a
Boolean operation on the destination operand `d` with the predicate `q` in the following manner:

```
p = (d != 0) BoolOp q;
```

The sink symbol ‘\_’ may be used in place of the destination operand `d` when `.BoolOp` qualifier
is specified.

The logical operation is defined by a look-up table which, for 3 inputs, can be represented as an
8-bit value specified by operand `immLut` as described below. `immLut` is an integer constant
that can take values from 0 to 255, thereby allowing up to 256 distinct logical operations on inputs
`a`, `b`, `c`.

For a logical operation `F(a, b, c)` the value of `immLut` can be computed by applying the same
operation to three predefined constant values as follows:

```
ta = 0xF0;
tb = 0xCC;
tc = 0xAA;

immLut = F(ta, tb, tc);
```

Examples:

```
If F = (a & b & c);
immLut = 0xF0 & 0xCC & 0xAA = 0x80

If F = (a | b | c);
immLut = 0xF0 | 0xCC | 0xAA = 0xFE

If F = (a & b & ~c);
immLut = 0xF0 & 0xCC & (~0xAA) = 0x40

If F = ((a & b | c) ^ a);
immLut = (0xF0 & 0xCC | 0xAA) ^ 0xF0 = 0x1A
```

The following table illustrates computation of `immLut` for various logical operations:

| ta | tb | tc | Oper 0 (False) | Oper 1 (ta & tb & tc) | Oper 2 (ta & tb & ~tc) | … | Oper 254 (ta | tb | tc) | Oper 255 (True) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | … | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **immLut** | | | **0x0** | **0x80** | **0x40** | **…** | **0xFE** | **0xFF** |

Semantics

```
F = GetFunctionFromTable(immLut); // returns the function corresponding to immLut value
d = F(a, b, c);
if (BoolOp specified) {
    p = (d != 0) BoolOp q;
}
```
