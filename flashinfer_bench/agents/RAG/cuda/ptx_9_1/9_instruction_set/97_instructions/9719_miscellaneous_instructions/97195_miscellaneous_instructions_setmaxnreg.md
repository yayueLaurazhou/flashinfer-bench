Description

`setmaxnreg` provides a hint to the system to update the maximum number of per-thread registers
owned by the executing warp to the value specified by the `imm-reg-count` operand.

Qualifier `.dec` is used to release extra registers such that the absolute per-thread maximum
register count is reduced from its current value to `imm-reg-count`. Qualifier `.inc` is used to
request additional registers such that the absolute per-thread maximum register count is increased
from its current value to `imm-reg-count`.

A pool of available registers is maintained per-CTA. Register adjustments requested by the
`setmaxnreg` instructions are handled by supplying extra registers from this pool to the
requesting warp or by releasing extra registers from the requesting warp to this pool, depending
upon the value of the `.action` qualifier.

The `setmaxnreg.inc` instruction blocks the execution until enough registers are available in the
CTA’s register pool. After the instruction `setmaxnreg.inc` obtains new registers from the CTA
pool, the initial contents of the new registers are undefined. The new registers must be initialized
before they are used.

The same `setmaxnreg` instruction must be executed by all warps in a
[warpgroup](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions-warpgroup). After executing a
`setmaxnreg` instruction, all warps in the *warpgroup* must synchronize explicitly before
executing subsequent setmaxnreg instructions. If a `setmaxnreg` instruction is not executed by all
warps in the *warpgroup*, then the behavior is undefined.

Operand `imm-reg-count` is an integer constant. The value of `imm-reg-count` must be in the
range 24 to 256 (both inclusive) and must be a multiple of 8.

Changes to the register file of the warp always happen at the tail-end of the register file.

The `setmaxnreg` instruction requires that the kernel has been launched with a valid value of
maximum number of per-thread registers specified via the appropriate compilation via the appropriate
compile-time option or the appropriate performance tuning directive. Otherwise, the `setmaxnreg`
instruction may have no effect.

When qualifier `.dec` is specified, the maximum number of per-thread registers owned by the warp
prior to the execution of `setmaxnreg` instruction should be greater than or equal to the
`imm-reg-count`. Otherwise, the behaviour is undefined.

When qualifier `.inc` is specified, the maximum number of per-thread registers owned by the warp
prior to the execution of `setmaxnreg` instruction should be less than or equal to the
`imm-reg-count`. Otherwise, the behaviour is undefined.

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `setmaxnreg` instruction causes the executing
thread to wait until all threads in the warp execute the same `setmaxnreg` instruction before
resuming execution.

The mandatory `.aligned` qualifier indicates that all threads in the warpgroup must execute the
same `setmaxnreg` instruction. In conditionally executed code, `setmaxnreg` instruction should
only be used if it is known that all threads in warpgroup evaluate the condition identically,
otherwise the behavior is undefined.
