# 9.7.12.5. Control Flow Instructions: call

#### 9.7.12.5. [Control Flow Instructions: `call`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#control-flow-instructions-call)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#control-flow-instructions-call "Permalink to this headline")

`call`

Call a function, recording the return location.

Syntax

```
// direct call to named function, func is a symbol
call{.uni} (ret-param), func, (param-list);
call{.uni} func, (param-list);
call{.uni} func;

// indirect call via pointer, with full list of call targets
call{.uni} (ret-param), fptr, (param-list), flist;
call{.uni} fptr, (param-list), flist;
call{.uni} fptr, flist;

// indirect call via pointer, with no knowledge of call targets
call{.uni} (ret-param), fptr, (param-list), fproto;
call{.uni} fptr, (param-list), fproto;
call{.uni} fptr, fproto;

Description

The `call` instruction stores the address of the next instruction, so execution can resume at that
point after executing a `ret` instruction. A `call` is assumed to be divergent unless the
`.uni` suffix is present. The `.uni` suffix indicates that the `call` is guaranteed to be
non-divergent, i.e. all active threads in a warp that are currently executing this instruction have
identical values for the guard predicate and `call` target.

For direct calls, the called location `func` must be a symbolic function name; for indirect calls,
the called location `fptr` must be an address of a function held in a register. Input arguments
and return values are optional. Arguments may be registers, immediate constants, or variables in
`.param` space. Arguments are pass-by-value.

Indirect calls require an additional operand, `flist` or `fproto`, to communicate the list of
potential `call` targets or the common function prototype of all `call` targets,
respectively. In the first case, `flist` gives a complete list of potential `call` targets and
the optimizing backend is free to optimize the calling convention. In the second case, where the
complete list of potential `call` targets may not be known, the common function prototype is given
and the `call` must obey the ABI’s calling convention.

The `flist` operand is either the name of an array (call table) initialized to a list of function
names; or a label associated with a `.calltargets` directive, which declares a list of potential
`call` targets. In both cases the fptr register holds the address of a function listed in the call
table or `.calltargets` list, and the `call` operands are type-checked against the type
signature of the functions indicated by `flist`.

The fproto operand is the name of a label associated with a `.callprototype` directive. This
operand is used when a complete list of potential targets is not known. The `call` operands are
type-checked against the prototype, and code generation will follow the ABI calling convention. If a
function that doesn’t match the prototype is called, the behavior is undefined.

Call tables may be declared at module scope or local scope, in either the constant or global state
space. The `.calltargets` and `.callprototype` directives must be declared within a function
body. All functions must be declared prior to being referenced in a `call` table initializer or
`.calltargets` directive.

PTX ISA Notes

Direct `call` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Indirect `call` introduced in PTX ISA version 2.1.

Target ISA Notes

Direct `call` supported on all target architectures. Indirect `call` requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
// examples of direct call
    call     init;    // call function 'init'
    call.uni g, (a);  // call function 'g' with parameter 'a'
@p  call     (d), h, (a, b);  // return value into register d
