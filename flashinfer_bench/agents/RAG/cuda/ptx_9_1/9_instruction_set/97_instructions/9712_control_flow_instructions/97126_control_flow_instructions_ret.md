Description

Return execution to caller’s environment. A divergent return suspends threads until all threads are
ready to return to the caller. This allows multiple divergent `ret` instructions.

A `ret` is assumed to be divergent unless the `.uni` suffix is present, indicating that the
return is guaranteed to be non-divergent.

Any values returned from a function should be moved into the return parameter variables prior to
executing the `ret` instruction.

A return instruction executed in a top-level entry routine will terminate thread execution.
