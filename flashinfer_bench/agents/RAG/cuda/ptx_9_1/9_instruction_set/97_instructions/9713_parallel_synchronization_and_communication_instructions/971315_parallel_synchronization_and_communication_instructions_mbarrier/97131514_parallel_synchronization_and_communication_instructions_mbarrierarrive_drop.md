`mbarrier.arrive_drop`

Decrements the expected count of the *mbarrier object* and performs [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on).

Syntax

```
mbarrier.arrive_drop{.sem.scope}{.shared{::cta}}.b64 state,           [addr]{, count};
mbarrier.arrive_drop{.sem.scope}{.shared::cluster}.b64           _,   [addr] {,count};
mbarrier.arrive_drop.expect_tx{.sem.scope}{.shared{::cta}}.b64 state, [addr], tx_count;
mbarrier.arrive_drop.expect_tx{.sem.scope}{.shared::cluster}.b64   _, [addr], tx_count;
mbarrier.arrive_drop.noComplete{.release.cta}{.shared{::cta}}.b64 state,  [addr], count;

.sem   = { .release, .relaxed }
.scope = { .cta, .cluster }

Description

A thread executing `mbarrier.arrive_drop` on the *mbarrier object* at the location specified by
the address operand `addr` performs the following steps:

* Decrements the expected arrival count of the *mbarrier object* by the value specified by the
  32-bit integer operand `count`. If `count` operand is not specified, it defaults to 1.
* Performs an [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) on the
  *mbarrier object*. The operand `count` specifies the *count* argument to the [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on).

The decrement done in the expected arrivals count of the *mbarrier object* will be for all the
subsequent phases of the *mbarrier object*.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is
used. If the address specified by `addr` does not fall within the address window of
`.shared::cta` or `.shared::cluster` state space then the behavior is undefined.

Supported addressing modes for operand `addr` is as described in [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands).
Alignment for operand `addr` is as described in the
[Size and alignment of mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-size-alignment).

The optional qualifier `.expect_tx` specifies that an [expect-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-expect-tx-operation)
operation is performed prior to the `arrive_drop` operation, i.e. the decrement of arrival count and
[arrive-on](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on)
operation. The 32-bit unsigned integer operand `txCount` specifies the *expectCount* argument to
the *expect-tx* operation. When both qualifiers `.arrive_drop` and `.expect_tx` are specified, then
the count argument of the *arrive-on* operation is assumed to be 1.

`mbarrier.arrive_drop` operation with `.release` qualifier forms the *release* pattern as
described in the Memory Consistency Model and synchronizes with the *acquire* patterns.

The optional `.sem` qualifier specifies a memory synchronizing effect as described in the
[Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model). If the `.sem` qualifier is absent,
`.release` is assumed by default. The `.relaxed` qualifier does not provide any memory
ordering semantics and visibility guarantees.

The optional `.scope` qualifier indicates the set of threads that an `mbarrier.arrive_drop`
instruction can directly synchronize. If the `.scope` qualifier is not specified then it defaults
to `.cta`. In contrast, the `.shared::<scope>` indicates the state space where the mbarrier
resides.

A `mbarrier.arrive_drop` with `.noComplete` qualifier must not complete the `mbarrier,`
otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The value of the operand `count` must be in the range as specified in
[Contents of the mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-contents).

Note: for `sm_8x`, when the argument `count` is specified, the modifier `.noComplete` is
required.

A thread that wants to either exit or opt out of participating in the [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) can use
`mbarrier.arrive_drop` to drop itself from the `mbarrier`.

`mbarrier.arrive_drop` operation on an *mbarrier object* located in `.shared::cta` returns an
opaque 64-bit register capturing the phase of the *mbarrier object* prior to the [arrive-on
operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on)
in the destination operand `state`. Contents of the returned state are implementation
specific. Optionally, sink symbol `'_'` can be used for the `state` argument.

`mbarrier.arrive_drop` operation on an *mbarrier* object located in `.shared::cluster` but not
in `.shared::cta` cannot return a value. Sink symbol ‘\_’ is mandatory for the destination operand
for such cases.

Qualifiers `.sem` and `.scope` must be specified together.
