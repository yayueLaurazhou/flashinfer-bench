[Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `match.sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-match-sync)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-match-sync "Permalink to this headline")

`match.sync`

Broadcast and compare a value across threads in warp.

Syntax

```
match.any.sync.type  d, a, membermask;
match.all.sync.type  d[|p], a, membermask;

.type = { .b32, .b64 };

Description

`match.sync` will cause executing thread to wait until all non-exited threads from `membermask`
have executed `match.sync` with the same qualifiers and same `membermask` value before resuming
execution.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating
in this instruction where the bit position corresponds to thread’s laneid.

`match.sync` performs broadcast and compare of operand `a` across all non-exited threads in
`membermask` and sets destination `d` and optional predicate `p` based on mode.

Operand `a` has instruction type and `d` has `.b32` type.

Destination `d` is a 32-bit mask where bit position in mask corresponds to thread’s laneid.

The matching operation modes are:

`.all`
:   `d` is set to mask corresponding to non-exited threads in `membermask` if all non-exited
    threads in `membermask` have same value of operand `a`; otherwise `d` is set
    to 0. Optionally predicate `p` is set to true if all non-exited threads in `membermask` have
    same value of operand `a`; otherwise `p` is set to false. The sink symbol ‘\_’ may be used in
    place of any one of the destination operands.

`.any`
:   `d` is set to mask of non-exited threads in `membermask` that have same value of operand
    `a`.

The behavior of `match.sync` is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `membermask`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_70` or higher.

Release Notes

Note that `match.sync` applies to threads in a single warp, not across an entire CTA.

Examples

```
match.any.sync.b32    d, a, 0xffffffff;
match.all.sync.b64    d|p, a, mask;
```
