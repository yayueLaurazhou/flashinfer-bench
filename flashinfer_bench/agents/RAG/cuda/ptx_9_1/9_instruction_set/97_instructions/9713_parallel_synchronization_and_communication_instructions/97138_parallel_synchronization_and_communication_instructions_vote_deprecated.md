# 9.7.13.8. Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: vote (deprecated)

#### 9.7.13.8. [Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `vote` (deprecated)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-vote)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-vote "Permalink to this headline")

`vote` (deprecated)

Vote across thread group.

Syntax

```
vote.mode.pred  d, {!}a;
vote.ballot.b32 d, {!}a;  // 'ballot' form, returns bitmask

.mode = { .all, .any, .uni };
```

Deprecation Note

The `vote` instruction without a `.sync` qualifier is deprecated in PTX ISA version 6.0.

* Support for this instruction with `.target` lower than `sm_70` may be removed in a future PTX
  ISA version.

Removal Note

Support for `vote` instruction without a `.sync` qualifier is removed in PTX ISA version 6.4 for
`.target` `sm_70` or higher.

Description

Performs a reduction of the source predicate across all active threads in a warp. The destination
predicate value is the same across all threads in the warp.

The reduction modes are:

`.all`
:   `True` if source predicate is `True` for all active threads in warp. Negate the source
    predicate to compute `.none`.

`.any`
:   `True` if source predicate is `True` for some active thread in warp. Negate the source
    predicate to compute `.not_all`.

`.uni`
:   `True` if source predicate has the same value in all active threads in warp. Negating the
    source predicate also computes `.uni`.

In the *ballot* form, `vote.ballot.b32` simply copies the predicate from each thread in a warp
into the corresponding bit position of destination register `d`, where the bit position
corresponds to the thread’s lane id.

An inactive thread in warp will contribute a 0 for its entry when participating in
`vote.ballot.b32`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.2.

Deprecated in PTX ISA version 6.0 in favor of `vote.sync`.

Not supported in PTX ISA version 6.4 for .target `sm_70` or higher.

Target ISA Notes

`vote` requires `sm_12` or higher.

`vote.ballot.b32` requires `sm_20` or higher.

`vote` is not supported on `sm_70` or higher starting PTX ISA version 6.4.

Release Notes

Note that `vote` applies to threads in a single warp, not across an entire CTA.

Examples

```
vote.all.pred    p,q;
vote.uni.pred    p,q;
vote.ballot.b32  r1,p;  // get 'ballot' across warp
```
