Description

A thread executing `mbarrier.arrive` performs an [arrive-on](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) operation
on the *mbarrier object* at the location specified by the address operand `addr`. The 32-bit
unsigned integer operand `count` specifies the *count* argument to the [arrive-on](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on)
operation.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is
used. If the address specified by `addr` does not fall within the address window of
`.shared::cta` state space then the behavior is undefined.

Supported addressing modes for operand `addr` is as described in [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands).
Alignment for operand `addr` is as described in the
[Size and alignment of mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-size-alignment).

The optional qualifier `.expect_tx` specifies that an [expect-tx](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-expect-tx-operation)
operation is performed prior to the [arrive-on](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on)
operation. The 32-bit unsigned integer operand `txCount` specifies the *expectCount* argument to
the *expect-tx* operation. When both qualifiers `.arrive` and `.expect_tx` are specified, then
the count argument of the *arrive-on* operation is assumed to be 1.

A `mbarrier.arrive` operation with `.noComplete` qualifier must not cause the `mbarrier` to
complete its current phase, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The value of the operand `count` must be in the range as specified in
[Contents of the mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-contents).

Note: for `sm_8x`, when the argument `count` is specified, the modifier `.noComplete` is
required.

`mbarrier.arrive` operation on an *mbarrier object* located in `.shared::cta` returns an opaque
64-bit register capturing the phase of the *mbarrier object* prior to the [arrive-on operation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-arrive-on) in the
destination operand `state.` Contents of the `state` operand are implementation
specific. Optionally, sink symbol `'_'` can be used for the `state` argument.

`mbarrier.arrive` operation on an *mbarrier object* located in `.shared::cluster` but not in
`.shared::cta` cannot return a value. Sink symbol ‘\_’ is mandatory for the destination operand for
such cases.

The optional `.sem` qualifier specifies a memory synchronizing effect as described in the
[Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model). If the `.sem` qualifier is absent,
`.release` is assumed by default.

The `.relaxed` qualifier does not provide any memory ordering semantics and visibility
guarantees.

The optional `.scope` qualifier indicates the set of threads that directly observe the memory
synchronizing effect of this operation, as described in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).
If the `.scope` qualifier is not specified then it
defaults to `.cta`. In contrast, the `.shared::<scope>` indicates the state space where the
mbarrier resides.

Qualifiers `.sem` and `.scope` must be specified together.
