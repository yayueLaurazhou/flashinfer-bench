#### 9.7.13.12. [Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `redux.sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-redux-sync)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-redux-sync "Permalink to this headline")

`redux.sync`

Perform reduction operation on the data from each predicated active thread in the thread group.

Syntax

```
redux.sync.op.type dst, src, membermask;
.op   = {.add, .min, .max}
.type = {.u32, .s32}

redux.sync.op.b32 dst, src, membermask;
.op   = {.and, .or, .xor}

redux.sync.op{.abs.}{.NaN}.f32 dst, src, membermask;
.op   = { .min, .max }
```

Description

`redux.sync` will cause the executing thread to wait until all non-exited threads corresponding to
`membermask` have executed `redux.sync` with the same qualifiers and same `membermask` value
before resuming execution.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating
in this instruction where the bit position corresponds to thread’s `laneid`.

`redux.sync` performs a reduction operation `.op` of the 32 bit source register `src` across
all non-exited threads in the `membermask`. The result of the reduction operation is written to
the 32 bit destination register `dst`.

Reduction operation can be one of the bitwise operation in `.and`, `.or`, `.xor` or arithmetic
operation in `.add`, `.min` , `.max`.

For the `.add` operation result is truncated to 32 bits.

For `.f32` instruction type, if the input value is 0.0 then +0.0 > -0.0.

If `.abs` qualifier is specified, then the absolute value of the input is considered for the
reduction operation.

If the `.NaN` qualifier is specified, then the result of the reduction operation is canonical NaN
if the input to the reduction operation from any participating thread is NaN.

In the absence of `.NaN` qualifier, only non-NaN values are considered for the reduction operation
and the result will be canonical NaN when all inputs are NaNs.

The behavior of `redux.sync` is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `membermask`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Support for `.f32` type is introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Support for `.abs` and `.NaN` qualifiers is introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_80` or higher.

`.f32` type requires `sm_100a` and is supported on `sm_100f` from PTX ISA version 8.8.

Qualifiers `.abs` and `.NaN` require `sm_100a` and are supported on `sm_100f` or
higher in the same family from PTX ISA version 8.8.

Release Notes

Note that `redux.sync` applies to threads in a single warp, not across an entire CTA.

Examples

```
.reg .b32 dst, src, init, mask;
redux.sync.add.s32 dst, src, 0xff;
redux.sync.xor.b32 dst, src, mask;

redux.sync.min.abs.NaN.f32 dst, src, mask;
