[Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `vote.sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-vote-sync)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-vote-sync "Permalink to this headline")

`vote.sync`

Vote across thread group.

Syntax

```
vote.sync.mode.pred  d, {!}a, membermask;
vote.sync.ballot.b32 d, {!}a, membermask;  // 'ballot' form, returns bitmask

.mode = { .all, .any, .uni };

Description

`vote.sync` will cause executing thread to wait until all non-exited threads corresponding to
`membermask` have executed `vote.sync` with the same qualifiers and same `membermask` value
before resuming execution.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating
in this instruction where the bit position corresponds to thread’s `laneid`. Operand `a` is a
predicate register.

In the *mode* form, `vote.sync` performs a reduction of the source predicate across all non-exited
threads in `membermask`. The destination operand `d` is a predicate register and its value is
the same across all threads in `membermask`.

The reduction modes are:

`.all`
:   `True` if source predicate is `True` for all non-exited threads in `membermask`. Negate the
    source predicate to compute `.none`.

`.any`
:   `True` if source predicate is `True` for some thread in `membermask`. Negate the source
    predicate to compute `.not_all`.

`.uni`
:   `True` if source predicate has the same value in all non-exited threads in
    `membermask`. Negating the source predicate also computes `.uni`.

In the *ballot* form, the destination operand `d` is a `.b32` register. In this form,
`vote.sync.ballot.b32` simply copies the predicate from each thread in `membermask` into the
corresponding bit position of destination register `d`, where the bit position corresponds to the
thread’s lane id.

A thread not specified in `membermask` will contribute a 0 for its entry in
`vote.sync.ballot.b32`.

The behavior of `vote.sync` is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `membermask`.

Note

For .target `sm_6x` or below, all threads in `membermask` must execute the same `vote.sync`
instruction in convergence, and only threads belonging to some `membermask` can be active when
the `vote.sync` instruction is executed. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_30` or higher.

Examples

```
vote.sync.all.pred    p,q,0xffffffff;
vote.sync.ballot.b32  r1,p,0xffffffff;  // get 'ballot' across warp
