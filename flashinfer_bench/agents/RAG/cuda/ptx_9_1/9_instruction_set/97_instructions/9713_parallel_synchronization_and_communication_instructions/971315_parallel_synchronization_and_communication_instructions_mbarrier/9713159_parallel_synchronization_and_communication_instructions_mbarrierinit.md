# 9.7.13.15.9. Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: mbarrier.init

##### 9.7.13.15.9. [Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: `mbarrier.init`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-init)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-init "Permalink to this headline")

`mbarrier.init`

Initialize the *mbarrier object*.

Syntax

```
mbarrier.init{.shared{::cta}}.b64 [addr], count;
```

Description

`mbarrier.init` initializes the *mbarrier object* at the location specified by the address operand
`addr` with the unsigned 32-bit integer `count`. The value of operand count must be in the range
as specified in [Contents of the mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-contents).

Initialization of the *mbarrier object* involves :

* Initializing the current phase to 0.
* Initializing the expected arrival count to `count`.
* Initializing the pending arrival count to `count`.
* Initializing the *tx-count* to 0.

The valid range of values for the operand `count` is [1, …, 220 - 1].
Refer [Contents of the mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-contents) for the
valid range of values for the various constituents of the mbarrier.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is
used. If the address specified by `addr` does not fall within the address window of
`.shared::cta` state space then the behavior is undefined.

Supported addressing modes for operand `addr` is as described in [Addresses as Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#addresses-as-operands).
Alignment for operand `addr` is as described in the
[Size and alignment of mbarrier object](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-size-alignment).

The behavior of performing an `mbarrier.init` operation on a memory location containing a
valid *mbarrier object* is undefined; invalidate the *mbarrier object* using `mbarrier.inval`
first, before repurposing the memory location for any other purpose, including another *mbarrier object*.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Support for sub-qualifier `::cta` on `.shared` introduced in PTX ISA version 7.8.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_80` or higher.

Examples

```
.shared .b64 shMem, shMem2;
.reg    .b64 addr;
.reg    .b32 %r1;

cvta.shared.u64          addr, shMem2;
mbarrier.init.b64        [addr],   %r1;
bar.cta.sync             0;
// ... other mbarrier operations on addr

mbarrier.init.shared::cta.b64 [shMem], 12;
bar.sync                 0;
// ... other mbarrier operations on shMem
