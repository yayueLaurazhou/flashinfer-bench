`bar.warp.sync`

Barrier synchronization for threads in a warp.

Syntax

```
bar.warp.sync      membermask;
```

Description

`bar.warp.sync` will cause executing thread to wait until all threads corresponding to
`membermask` have executed a `bar.warp.sync` with the same `membermask` value before resuming
execution.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating
in barrier where the bit position corresponds to thread’s `laneid`.

The behavior of `bar.warp.sync` is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `membermask`.

`bar.warp.sync` also guarantee memory ordering among threads participating in barrier. Thus,
threads within warp that wish to communicate via memory can store to memory, execute
`bar.warp.sync`, and then safely read values stored by other threads in warp.

Note

For .target `sm_6x` or below, all threads in `membermask` must execute the same
`bar.warp.sync` instruction in convergence, and only threads belonging to some `membermask`
can be active when the `bar.warp.sync` instruction is executed. Otherwise, the behavior is
undefined.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_30` or higher.

Examples

```
st.shared.u32 [r0],r1;         // write my result to shared memory
bar.warp.sync  0xffffffff;     // arrive, wait for others to arrive
ld.shared.u32 r2,[r3];         // read results written by other threads
