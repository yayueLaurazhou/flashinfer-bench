###### 9.7.15.5.1.2.1.3. [Canonical Layouts](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-canonical-layouts)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-canonical-layouts "Permalink to this headline")

In terms of [CuTe layouts](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/cute/01_layout.html)
the canonical layout can be expressed as follows:

| Major- ness | Swizzling mode | Canonical Layout without swizzling | [Swizzling](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/bf9da7b76c766d7ee7d536afc77880a4ef1f1156/include/cute/swizzle.hpp) on the previous column |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MN- major | No-swizzling or Interleaved | ((T,1,m),(8,k)):((1,T,SBO),(1T,LBO)) | Swizzle<0, 4, 3> |
| 32B Swizzling | ((T,2,m),(8,k)):((1,T,LBO),(2T,SBO)) | Swizzle<1, 4, 3> |
| 64B Swizzling | ((T,4,m),(8,k)):((1,T,LBO),(4T,SBO)) | Swizzle<2, 4, 3> |
| 128B Swizzling | ((T,8,m),(8,k)):((1,T,LBO),(8T,SBO)) | Swizzle<3, 4, 3> |
| K- major | No-swizzling or Interleaved | ((8,m),(T,2k)):((1T,SBO),(1,LBO)) | Swizzle<0, 4, 3> |
| 32B Swizzling | ((8,m),(T,2k)):((2T,SBO),(1,T)) | Swizzle<1, 4, 3> |
| 64B Swizzling | ((8,m),(T,2k)):((4T,SBO),(1,T)) | Swizzle<2, 4, 3> |
| 128B Swizzling | ((8,m),(T,2k)):((8T,SBO),(1,T)) | Swizzle<3, 4, 3> |

where

* T = 128 / sizeof-elements-in-bits
  T represents scale factor which normalizes matrix element types to 128-bits.
* m represents the number of repeating patterns across rows.
* k represents the number of repeating patterns across columns.

Examples

* K-Major, no-swizzling and tf32 type: [Figure 166](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#async-warpgroup-k-no-swizzle-tf32)
