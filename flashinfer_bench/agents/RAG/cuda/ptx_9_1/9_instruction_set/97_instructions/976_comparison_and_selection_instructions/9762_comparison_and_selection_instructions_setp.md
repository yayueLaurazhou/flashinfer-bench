# 9.7.6.2. Comparison and Selection Instructions: setp

#### 9.7.6.2. [Comparison and Selection Instructions: `setp`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions-setp)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#comparison-and-selection-instructions-setp "Permalink to this headline")

`setp`

Compare two numeric values with a relational operator, and (optionally) combine this result with a
predicate value by applying a Boolean operator.

Syntax

```
setp.CmpOp{.ftz}.type         p[|q], a, b;
setp.CmpOp.BoolOp{.ftz}.type  p[|q], a, b, {!}c;

.CmpOp  = { eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, lo, ls, hi, hs,
            equ, neu, ltu, leu, gtu, geu, num, nan };
.BoolOp = { and, or, xor };
.type   = { .b16, .b32, .b64,
            .u16, .u32, .u64,
            .s16, .s32, .s64,
                  .f32, .f64 };

Description

Compares two values and combines the result with another predicate value by applying a Boolean
operator. This result is written to the first destination operand. A related value computed using
the complement of the compare result is written to the second destination operand.

Applies to all numeric types. Operands `a` and `b` have type `.type`; operands `p`, `q`,
and `c` have type `.pred`. The sink symbol ‘\_’ may be used in place of any one of the
destination operands.

Semantics

```
t = (a CmpOp b) ? 1 : 0;
p = BoolOp(t, c);
q = BoolOp(!t, c);
```

Integer Notes

The signed and unsigned comparison operators are `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`.

For unsigned values, the comparison operators `lo`, `ls`, `hi`, and `hs` for lower,
lower-or-same, higher, and higher-or-same may be used instead of `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`,
respectively.

The untyped, bit-size comparisons are `eq` and `ne`.

Floating Point Notes

The ordered comparisons are `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`. If either operand is `NaN`, the result is `False`.

To aid comparison operations in the presence of `NaN` values, unordered versions are included:
`equ`, `neu`, `ltu`, `leu`, `gtu`, `geu`. If both operands are numeric values (not
`NaN`), then these comparisons have the same result as their ordered counterparts. If either
operand is `NaN`, then the result of these comparisons is `True`.

`num` returns `True` if both operands are numeric values (not `NaN`), and `nan` returns
`True` if either operand is `NaN`.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`
:   By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

    `setp.ftz.dtype.f32` flushes subnormal inputs to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
:   `setp.dtype.f64` supports subnormal numbers.

    `setp.dtype.f32` flushes subnormal inputs to sign-preserving zero.

Modifier `.ftz` applies only to `.f32` comparisons.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

`setp` with `.f64` source type requires `sm_13` or higher.

Examples

```
    setp.lt.and.s32  p|q,a,b,r;
@q  setp.eq.u32      p,i,n;
```
