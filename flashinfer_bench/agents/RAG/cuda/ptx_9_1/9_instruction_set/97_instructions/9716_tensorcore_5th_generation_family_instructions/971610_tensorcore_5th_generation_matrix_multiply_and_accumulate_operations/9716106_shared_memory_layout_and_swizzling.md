# 9.7.16.10.6. Shared Memory Layout and Swizzling

##### 9.7.16.10.6. [Shared Memory Layout and Swizzling](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-shared-memory-layout-swizzling)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-shared-memory-layout-swizzling "Permalink to this headline")

If the bit `Transpose A Matrix` / `Transpose B Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 0, then *K-major* is
used for matrix `A` / `B` respectively. If the bit `Transpose A Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 1 then *M-major* is
used for matrix `A`. If the bit `Transpose B Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 1, then *N-major* is
used for matrix `B`.

In a column-major default BLAS library such as cuBLAS, the matrices `A` and `B` with and
without transpose can be classified as either *K-Major* or *M-or-N-Major* as shown in the
following table:

|  | Non-Transposed | Transposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | K-major | M-major |
| B | K-major | N-major |

To avoid confusion with `A`, `B`, `row-major`, `col-major`, `transpose`, and
`non-transpose`, we will use *MN-Major* and *K-Major* throughout this section.

The matrices in the shared memory are made up of one or more “swizzle layout atom”.
The exact layout of these swizzle atoms depends on the swizzling mode, swizzle-atomicity,
and the leading dimension. The layout of the swizzle are shown in
[Table 55](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-smem-swizzle-mode)

Table 55 Layout for swizzle atoms[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-smem-swizzle-mode "Permalink to this table")





| Swizzling mode and Swizzle-Atomicity | Leading Dimension | Swizzle atom layout (128b element) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 128B Swizzling with 32B atomicity | M/N | 8x4 |
| – | – |
| 128B Swizzling with 16B atomicity | M/N | 8x8 |
| K | 8x8 |
| 64B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 4x8 |
| K | 8x4 |
| 32B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 2x8 |
| K | 8x2 |
| None | M/N | 1x8 |
| K | 8x1 |

The above shapes are for elements of size 128 bits. For smaller element sizes, the same shapes
would get multiplied along the leading dimension by a factor of `128 / sizeof_bits(Element)`.
For example, 128B MN major swizzle atom would have a shape of (8\*(128/32))x8 = 32x8 for
tf32 tensor core inputs.

Some example Layouts of *MxK* or *KxN* matrices with various swizzling modes, and are in units
of 128b elements as shown by each colored cell as shown in
