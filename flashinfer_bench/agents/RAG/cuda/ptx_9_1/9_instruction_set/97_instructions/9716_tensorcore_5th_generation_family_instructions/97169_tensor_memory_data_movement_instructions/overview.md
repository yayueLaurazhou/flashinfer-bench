#### 9.7.16.9. [Tensor Memory Data Movement Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-data-movement-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-data-movement-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

Data from the shared memory can be copied asynchronously to the [Tensor Memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-memory)
using the [Tensorcore 5th Generation Instructions: tcgen05.cp](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instructions-tcgen05-cp) operation.
