# 9.7.16.4.2. Instruction descriptor

##### 9.7.16.4.2. [Instruction descriptor](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor "Permalink to this headline")

The instruction descriptor describes the shapes, types and other details of all the matrices
and the matrix-multiplication-and-accumulation operation. It is a 32-bit value in registers
and the exact layout is dependent on the MMA-Kind:
