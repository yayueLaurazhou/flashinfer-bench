Description

Exchange register data between threads of a warp.

`shfl.sync` will cause executing thread to wait until all non-exited threads corresponding to
`membermask` have executed `shfl.sync` with the same qualifiers and same `membermask` value
before resuming execution.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating
in barrier where the bit position corresponds to thread’s `laneid`.

`shfl.sync` exchanges register data between threads in `membermask`.

Each thread in the currently executing warp will compute a source lane index *j* based on input
operands `b` and `c` and the *mode*. If the computed source lane index *j* is in range, the
thread will copy the input operand `a` from lane *j* into its own destination register `d`;
otherwise, the thread will simply copy its own input `a` to destination `d`. The optional
destination predicate `p` is set to `True` if the computed source lane is in range, and
otherwise set to `False`.

Note that an out of range value of `b` may still result in a valid computed source lane index
*j*. In this case, a data transfer occurs and the destination predicate `p` is True.

Note that results are undefined if a thread sources a register from an inactive thread or a thread
that is not in `membermask`.

Operand `b` specifies a source lane or source lane offset, depending on the mode.

Operand `c` contains two packed values specifying a mask for logically splitting warps into
sub-segments and an upper bound for clamping the source lane index.

The behavior of `shfl.sync` is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `membermask`.

Note

For .target `sm_6x` or below, all threads in `membermask` must execute the same `shfl.sync`
instruction in convergence, and only threads belonging to some `membermask` can be active when
the `shfl.sync` instruction is executed. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Semantics

```
// wait for all threads in membermask to arrive
wait_for_specified_threads(membermask);

lane[4:0]  = [Thread].laneid;  // position of thread in warp
bval[4:0] = b[4:0];            // source lane or lane offset (0..31)
cval[4:0] = c[4:0];            // clamp value
segmask[4:0] = c[12:8];

// get value of source register a if thread is active and
// guard predicate true, else unpredictable
if (isActive(Thread) && isGuardPredicateTrue(Thread)) {
    SourceA[lane] = a;
} else {
    // Value of SourceA[lane] is unpredictable for
    // inactive/predicated-off threads in warp
}
maxLane = (lane[4:0] & segmask[4:0]) | (cval[4:0] & ~segmask[4:0]);
minLane = (lane[4:0] & segmask[4:0]);

switch (.mode) {
    case .up:    j = lane - bval; pval = (j >= maxLane); break;
    case .down:  j = lane + bval; pval = (j <= maxLane); break;
    case .bfly:  j = lane ^ bval; pval = (j <= maxLane); break;
    case .idx:   j = minLane  | (bval[4:0] & ~segmask[4:0]);
                                 pval = (j <= maxLane); break;
}
if (!pval) j = lane;  // copy from own lane
d = SourceA[j];       // copy input a from lane j
if (dest predicate selected)
    p = pval;
