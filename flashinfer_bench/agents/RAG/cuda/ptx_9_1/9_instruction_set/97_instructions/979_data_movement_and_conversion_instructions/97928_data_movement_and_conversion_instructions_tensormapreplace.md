`tensormap.replace`

Modifies the field of a tensor-map object.

Syntax

```
tensormap.replace.mode.field1{.ss}.b1024.type  [addr], new_val;
tensormap.replace.mode.field2{.ss}.b1024.type  [addr], ord, new_val;
tensormap.replace.mode.field3{.ss}.b1024.type  [addr], new_val;

.mode    = { .tile }
.field1  = { .global_address, .rank }
.field2  = { .box_dim, .global_dim, .global_stride, .element_stride  }
.field3  = { .elemtype,  .interleave_layout, .swizzle_mode, .swizzle_atomicity, .fill_mode }
.ss      = { .global, .shared::cta }
.type    = { .b32, .b64 }

Description

The `tensormap.replace` instruction replaces the field, specified by `.field` qualifier,
of the tensor-map object at the location specified by the address operand `addr` with a
new value. The new value is specified by the argument `new_val`.

Qualifier `.mode` specifies the mode of the [tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap) object
located at the address operand `addr`.

Instruction type `.b1024` indicates the size of the [tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap)
object, which is 1024 bits.

Operand `new_val` has the type `.type`. When `.field` is specified as `.global_address`
or `.global_stride`, `.type` must be `.b64`. Otherwise, `.type` must be `.b32`.

The immediate integer operand `ord` specifies the ordinal of the field across the rank of the
tensor which needs to be replaced in the [tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap) object.

For field `.rank`, the operand `new_val` must be ones less than the desired tensor rank as
this field uses zero-based numbering.

When `.field3` is specified, the operand `new_val` must be an immediate and the
[Table 33](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensormap-new-val-validity) shows the mapping of the operand `new_val` across various fields.

Note

The values of `.elemtype` do not correspond to the values of the `CUtensorMapDataType` enum used in the driver API.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#generic-addressing) is used.
If the address specified by `addr` does not fall within the address window of `.global`
or `.shared::cta` state space then the behavior is undefined.

`tensormap.replace` is treated as a weak memory operation, on the entire 1024-bit opaque
[tensor-map](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tensormap) object, in the [Memory Consistency Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#memory-consistency-model).
