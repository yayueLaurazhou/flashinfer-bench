# 9.7.9.2. Cache Eviction Priority Hints

#### 9.7.9.2. [Cache Eviction Priority Hints](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#cache-eviction-priority-hints)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#cache-eviction-priority-hints "Permalink to this headline")

PTX ISA version 7.4 adds optional cache eviction priority hints on load and store
instructions. Cache eviction priority requires target architecture `sm_70` or higher.

Cache eviction priority on load or store instructions is treated as a performance hint. It is
supported for `.global` state space and generic addresses where the address points to `.global`
state space.

| Cache Eviction Priority | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `evict_normal` | Cache data with normal eviction priority. This is the default eviction priority. |
| `evict_first` | Data cached with this priority will be first in the eviction priority order and will likely be evicted when cache eviction is required. This priority is suitable for streaming data. |
| `evict_last` | Data cached with this priority will be last in the eviction priority order and will likely be evicted only after other data with `evict_normal` or `evict_first` eviction priotity is already evicted. This priority is suitable for data that should remain persistent in cache. |
| `evict_unchanged` | Do not change eviction priority order as part of this operation. |
| `no_allocate` | Do not allocate data to cache. This priority is suitable for streaming data. |
