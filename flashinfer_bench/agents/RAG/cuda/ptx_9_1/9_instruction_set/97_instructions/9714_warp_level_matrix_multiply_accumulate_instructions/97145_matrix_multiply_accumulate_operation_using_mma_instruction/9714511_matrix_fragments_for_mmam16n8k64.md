# 9.7.14.5.11. Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k64

##### 9.7.14.5.11. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k64`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16864)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16864 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k64` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k64`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s4` / `.u4` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight `.s4` / `.u4` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, …, a30, a31 |
  | `.e2m1` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight `.e2m1` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, …, a30, a31 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 93](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16864-a).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =     groupID                                     for ai where 0 <= i < 8 || 16 <= i < 24
          groupID + 8                                   otherwise

  col =      (threadID_in_group * 8) + (i & 0x7)        for ai where i < 16
             (threadID_in_group * 8) + (i & 0x7) + 32   for ai where i >= 16
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s4` / `.u4` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight `.s4` / `.u4` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, …, b14, b15 |
  | `.e2m1` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight `.e2m1` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, …, b14, b15 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 94](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16864-b-1)
  and [Figure 95](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16864-b-2).

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression containing four `.s32` registers, containing four `.s32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c2, c3 |
  | `.f32` | A vector expression containing four `.f32` registers, containing four `.f32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c2, c3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 96](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16864-c).
