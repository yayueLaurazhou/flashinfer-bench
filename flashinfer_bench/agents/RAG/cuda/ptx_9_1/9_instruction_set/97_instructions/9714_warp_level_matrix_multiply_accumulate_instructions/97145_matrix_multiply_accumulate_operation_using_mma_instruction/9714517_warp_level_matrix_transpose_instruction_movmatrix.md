# 9.7.14.5.17. Warp-level matrix transpose instruction: movmatrix

##### 9.7.14.5.17. [Warp-level matrix transpose instruction: `movmatrix`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-instructions-movmatrix)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-instructions-movmatrix "Permalink to this headline")

`movmatrix`

Transpose a matrix in registers across the warp.

Syntax

```
movmatrix.sync.aligned.shape.trans.type d, a;

.shape  = {.m8n8};
.type   = {.b16};
```

Description

Move a row-major matrix across all threads in a warp, reading elements from source `a`, and
writing the transposed elements to destination `d`.

The `.shape` qualifier indicates the dimensions of the matrix being transposed. Each matrix
element holds 16-bit data as indicated by the `.type` qualifier.

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `movmatrix` causes the executing thread to wait
until all threads in the warp execute the same `movmatrix` instruction before resuming execution.

The mandatory `.aligned` qualifier indicates that all threads in the warp must execute the same
`movmatrix` instruction. In conditionally executed code, a `movmatrix` instruction should only
be used if it is known that all threads in the warp evaluate the condition identically, otherwise
the behavior is undefined.

Operands `a` and `d` are 32-bit registers containing fragments of the input matrix and the
resulting matrix respectively. The mandatory qualifier `.trans` indicates that the resulting
matrix in `d` is a transpose of the input matrix specified by `a`.

Each thread in a warp holds a fragment of a row of the input matrix, with thread 0 holding the first
fragment in register `a`, and so on. A group of four threads holds an entire row of the input
matrix as shown in [Figure 109](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-movmatrix-fragments-src).

Each thread in a warp holds a fragment of a column of the result matrix, with thread 0 holding the
first fragment in register `d`, and so on. A group of four threads holds an entire column of the
result matrix as shown in [Figure 110](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-movmatrix-fragments-dst).
