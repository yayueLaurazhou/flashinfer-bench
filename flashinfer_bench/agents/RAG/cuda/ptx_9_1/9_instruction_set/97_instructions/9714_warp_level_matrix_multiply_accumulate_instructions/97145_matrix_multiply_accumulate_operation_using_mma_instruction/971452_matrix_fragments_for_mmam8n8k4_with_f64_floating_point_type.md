# 9.7.14.5.2. Matrix Fragments for mma.m8n8k4 with .f64 floating point type

##### 9.7.14.5.2. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m8n8k4` with `.f64` floating point type](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-884-f64)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-884-f64 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m8n8k4` with `.f64` floating point type will compute an MMA operation of
shape `.m8n8k4`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f64` | A vector expression containing a single `.f64` register, containing single `.f64` element from the matrix A. | a0 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 53](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-884-a-f64).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  row =        %laneid >> 2

  col =        %laneid % 4
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f64` | A vector expression containing a single `.f64` register, containing a single `.f64` element from the matrix B. | b0 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 54](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-884-b-f64).

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f64` | A vector expression containing of two `.f64` registers containing two `.f64` elements from the matrix C. | c0, c1 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 55](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-884-c-f64).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =      groupID

  col =      (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1)       for ci   where i = {0, 1}
