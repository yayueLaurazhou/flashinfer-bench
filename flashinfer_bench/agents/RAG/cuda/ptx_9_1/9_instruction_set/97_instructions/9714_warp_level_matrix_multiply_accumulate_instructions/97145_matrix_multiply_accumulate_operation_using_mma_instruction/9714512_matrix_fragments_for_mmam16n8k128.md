# 9.7.14.5.12. Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k128

##### 9.7.14.5.12. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k128`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-168128)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-168128 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k128` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k128`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.b1` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing thirty two `.b1` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, …, a62, a63 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 97](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-168128-a).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =      groupID                              for ai where i < 32
            groupID + 8                           for ai where i >= 32

  col =  (threadID_in_group * 32) + (i & 0x1F)     for ai where i = {0, ...,63}
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.b1` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register containing thirty two `.b1` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, … , b30, b31 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 98](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-168128-b).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =  (threadID_in_group * 32) + i         for bi where i = {0,...,31}
  col = groupID

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression containing four `.s32` registers, containing four `.s32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c2, c3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 99](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-168128-c).
