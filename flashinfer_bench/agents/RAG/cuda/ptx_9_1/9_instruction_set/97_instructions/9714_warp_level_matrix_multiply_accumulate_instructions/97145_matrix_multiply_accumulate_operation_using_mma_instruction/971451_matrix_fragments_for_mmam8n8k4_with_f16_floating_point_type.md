# 9.7.14.5.1. Matrix Fragments for mma.m8n8k4 with .f16 floating point type

##### 9.7.14.5.1. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m8n8k4` with `.f16` floating point type](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-884-f16)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-884-f16 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m8n8k4` with `.f16` floating point type will compute 4 MMA operations of shape
`.m8n8k4`.

Elements of 4 matrices need to be distributed across the threads in a warp. The following table
shows distribution of matrices for MMA operations.

| MMA Computation | Threads participating in MMA computation |
| --- | --- |
| MMA computation 1 | Threads with `%laneid` 0-3 (low group) and 16-19 (high group) |
| MMA computation 2 | Threads with `%laneid` 4-7 (low group) and 20-23 (high group) |
| MMA computation 3 | Threads with `%laneid` 8-11 (low group) and 24-27 (high group) |
| MMA computation 4 | Threads with `%laneid` 12-15 (low group) and 28-31 (high group) |

For each of the individual MMA computation shown above, each of the required thread holds a fragment
of the matrix for performing mma operation as follows:

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f16` | A vector expression containing two `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown below:

    The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

    ```
    row =            %laneid % 4          if %laneid < 16
                    (%laneid % 4) + 4     otherwise

    col =            i                    for ai where i = {0,..,3}
    ```
