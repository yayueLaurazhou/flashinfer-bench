# 9.7.14.5.9. Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k16 with integer type

##### 9.7.14.5.9. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k16` with integer type](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16816-i8-f8)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16816-i8-f8 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k16` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u8` / `.s8` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing four `.u8` / `.s8` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |
  | `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing four `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 84](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16816-a-i8).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =      groupID                            for ai where i < 4
           groupID + 8                          for ai where i >= 4

  col =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + (i & 0x3)    for ai where i = {0,..,7}
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u8` / `.s8` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.u8` / `.s8` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3 |
  | `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1. b2. b3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 85](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16816-b-i8).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + i         for bi where i = {0,..,3}

  col = groupID
  ```

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression containing four `.s32` registers, containing four `.s32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c2, c3 |
  | `.f32` | A vector expression containing four `.f32` registers, containing four `.f32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c2, c3 |
  | `.f16` | A vector expression containing two `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1, c1, c2 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 86](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-16816-c-i8).
