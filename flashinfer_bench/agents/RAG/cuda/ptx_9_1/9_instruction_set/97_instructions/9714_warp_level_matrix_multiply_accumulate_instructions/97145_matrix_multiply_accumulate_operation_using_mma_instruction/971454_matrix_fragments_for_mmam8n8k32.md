# 9.7.14.5.4. Matrix Fragments for mma.m8n8k32

##### 9.7.14.5.4. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m8n8k32`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-8832)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-8832 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m8n8k32` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m8n8k32`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s4` / `.u4` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing eight `.s4` or `.u4` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 59](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8832-a-i4).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =      groupID

  col = (threadID_in_group * 8) + i         for ai    where i = {0,..,7}
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s4` / `.u4` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing eight `.s4` or `.u4` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 60](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8832-b-i4).

  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row = (threadID_in_group * 8) + i         for bi   where i = {0,..,7}

  col = groupID

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression of two `.s32` registers. | c0, c1 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 61](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8832-c-i4):
