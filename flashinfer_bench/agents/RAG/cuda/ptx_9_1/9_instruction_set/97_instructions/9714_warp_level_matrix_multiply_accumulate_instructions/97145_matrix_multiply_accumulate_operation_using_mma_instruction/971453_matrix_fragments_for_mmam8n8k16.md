# 9.7.14.5.3. Matrix Fragments for mma.m8n8k16

##### 9.7.14.5.3. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m8n8k16`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-8816)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-8816 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m8n8k16` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m8n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s8` / `.u8` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.s8` or `.u8` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 56](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8816-a-i8).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row = groupID

  col =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + i       for ai    where i = {0,..,3}
  ```

* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s8` / `.u8` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.s8` or `.u8` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 57](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8816-b-i8).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + i         for bi    where i = {0,..,3}

  col =    groupID

* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression containing of two `.s32` registers. | c0, c1 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 58](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-8816-c-i8).
