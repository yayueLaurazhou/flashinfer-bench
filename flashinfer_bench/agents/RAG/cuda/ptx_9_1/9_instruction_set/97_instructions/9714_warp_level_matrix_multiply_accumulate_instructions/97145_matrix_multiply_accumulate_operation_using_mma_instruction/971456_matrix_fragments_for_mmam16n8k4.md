# 9.7.14.5.6. Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k4

##### 9.7.14.5.6. [Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k4`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-1684)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-1684 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k4` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k4`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  + `.tf32`:

    | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `.tf32` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, containing two `.tf32` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1 |

    The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 65](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#mma-1684-a-tf32).

    The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

    ```
    groupID           = %laneid >> 2
    threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

    row =      groupID            for a0
               groupID + 8        for a1

    col =  threadID_in_group
    ```
