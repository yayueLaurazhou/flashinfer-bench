# 9.7.14.6.2.7. Matrix Fragments for sparse mma.m16n8k64 with .u4 / .s4 integer type

###### 9.7.14.6.2.7. [Matrix Fragments for sparse `mma.m16n8k64` with `.u4` / `.s4` integer type](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-mma-16864-u4s4)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-mma-16864-u4s4 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing sparse `mma.m16n8k64` with `.u4` / `.s4` integer type will compute an MMA
operation of shape `.m16n8k64`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u4` / `.s4` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight non-zero `.u4` / `.s4` elements out of 16 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-sparse-matrix-storage). |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 138](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#sparse-mma-16864-u4s4-a).

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4

  row =      groupID            for ai where  0 <= i < 8
             groupID + 8        Otherwise

  col = [firstcol ... lastcol]  // As per the mapping of non-zero elements
                                // as described in Sparse matrix storage

  Where
  firstcol = threadID_in_group * 16
  lastcol  = firstcol + 15

* Matrix fragments for multiplicand B and accumulators C and D are the same as in case of
  [Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k64](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16864).
* Metadata: A `.b32` register containing 16 2-bit vectors with each pair of 2-bit vectors storing
  the indices of four non-zero elements from a 8-wide chunk of matrix A as shown in
  [Figure 139](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#sparse-mma-metadata-16864-u4s4).
