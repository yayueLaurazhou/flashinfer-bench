# 9.7.3. Floating-Point Instructions

### 9.7.3. [Floating-Point Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

Floating-point instructions operate on `.f32` and `.f64` register operands and constant
immediate values. The floating-point instructions are:

* `testp`
* `copysign`
* `add`
* `sub`
* `mul`
* `fma`
* `mad`
* `div`
* `abs`
* `neg`
* `min`
* `max`
* `rcp`
* `sqrt`
* `rsqrt`
* `sin`
* `cos`
* `lg2`
* `ex2`
* `tanh`

Instructions that support rounding modifiers are IEEE-754 compliant. Double-precision instructions
support subnormal inputs and results. Single-precision instructions support subnormal inputs and
results by default for `sm_20` and subsequent targets, and flush subnormal inputs and results to
sign-preserving zero for `sm_1x` targets. The optional `.ftz` modifier on single-precision
instructions provides backward compatibility with `sm_1x` targets by flushing subnormal inputs and
results to sign-preserving zero regardless of the target architecture.

Single-precision `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `mad` support saturation of results to the range
[0.0, 1.0], with `NaN`s being flushed to positive zero. `NaN` payloads are supported for
double-precision instructions (except for `rcp.approx.ftz.f64` and `rsqrt.approx.ftz.f64`, which
maps input `NaN`s to a canonical `NaN`). Single-precision instructions return an unspecified
`NaN`. Note that future implementations may support `NaN` payloads for single-precision
instructions, so PTX programs should not rely on the specific single-precision `NaN`s being
generated.

[Table 29](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#floating-point-instructions-summary-of-floating-point-instructions) summarizes
floating-point instructions in PTX.
