# 9.2. PTX Instructions

## 9.2. [PTX Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-instructions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-instructions "Permalink to this headline")

PTX instructions generally have from zero to four operands, plus an optional guard predicate
appearing after an `@` symbol to the left of the `opcode`:

* `@p   opcode;`
* `@p   opcode a;`
* `@p   opcode d, a;`
* `@p   opcode d, a, b;`
* `@p   opcode d, a, b, c;`

For instructions that create a result value, the `d` operand is the destination operand, while
`a`, `b`, and `c` are source operands.

The `setp` instruction writes two destination registers. We use a `|` symbol to separate
multiple destination registers.

```
setp.lt.s32  p|q, a, b;  // p = (a < b); q = !(a < b);
```

For some instructions the destination operand is optional. A *bit bucket* operand denoted with an
underscore (`_`) may be used in place of a destination register.
