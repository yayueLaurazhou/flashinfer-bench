# 9.4.1. Operand Size Exceeding Instruction-Type Size

### 9.4.1. [Operand Size Exceeding Instruction-Type Size](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#operand-size-exceeding-instruction-type-size)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#operand-size-exceeding-instruction-type-size "Permalink to this headline")

For convenience, `ld`, `st`, and `cvt` instructions permit source and destination data
operands to be wider than the instruction-type size, so that narrow values may be loaded, stored,
and converted using regular-width registers. For example, 8-bit or 16-bit values may be held
directly in 32-bit or 64-bit registers when being loaded, stored, or converted to other types and
sizes. The operand type checking rules are relaxed for bit-size and integer (signed and unsigned)
instruction types; floating-point instruction types still require that the operand type-size matches
exactly, unless the operand is of bit-size type.

When a source operand has a size that exceeds the instruction-type size, the source data is
truncated (chopped) to the appropriate number of bits specified by the instruction type-size.

[Table 27](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#operand-size-exceeding-instruction-type-size-relaxed-type-checking-rules-source-operands)
summarizes the relaxed type-checking rules for source operands. Note that some combinations may
still be invalid for a particular instruction; for example, the `cvt` instruction does not support
`.bX` instruction types, so those rows are invalid for `cvt`.

Source register size must be of equal or greater size than the instruction-type size. 2. Bit-size source registers may be used with any appropriately-sized instruction type. The data are    truncated (“chopped”) to the instruction-type size and interpreted according to the instruction    type. 3. Integer source registers may be used with any appropriately-sized bit-size or integer instruction    type. The data are truncated to the instruction-type size and interpreted according to the    instruction type. 4. Floating-point source registers can only be used with bit-size or floating-point instruction types.    When used with a narrower bit-size instruction type, the data are truncated. When used with a    floating-point instruction type, the size must match exactly. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

When a destination operand has a size that exceeds the instruction-type size, the destination data
is zero- or sign-extended to the size of the destination register. If the corresponding instruction
type is signed integer, the data is sign-extended; otherwise, the data is zero-extended.
