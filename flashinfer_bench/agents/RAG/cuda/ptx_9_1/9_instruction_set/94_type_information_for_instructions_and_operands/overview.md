# 9.4. Type Information for Instructions and Operands

## 9.4. [Type Information for Instructions and Operands](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#type-information-for-instructions-and-operands)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#type-information-for-instructions-and-operands "Permalink to this headline")

Typed instructions must have a type-size modifier. For example, the `add` instruction requires
type and size information to properly perform the addition operation (signed, unsigned, float,
different sizes), and this information must be specified as a suffix to the opcode.

Example

```
.reg .u16 d, a, b;

add.u16 d, a, b;    // perform a 16-bit unsigned add
```

Some instructions require multiple type-size modifiers, most notably the data conversion instruction
`cvt`. It requires separate type-size modifiers for the result and source, and these are placed in
the same order as the operands. For example:

```
.reg .u16 a;
.reg .f32 d;

cvt.f32.u16 d, a;   // convert 16-bit unsigned to 32-bit float
```

In general, an operand’s type must agree with the corresponding instruction-type modifier. The rules
for operand and instruction type conformance are as follows:

* Bit-size types agree with any type of the same size.
* Signed and unsigned integer types agree provided they have the same size, and integer operands are
  silently cast to the instruction type if needed. For example, an unsigned integer operand used in
  a signed integer instruction will be treated as a signed integer by the instruction.
* Floating-point types agree only if they have the same size; i.e., they must match exactly.

[Table 26](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#type-information-for-instructions-and-operands-type-checking-rules) summarizes these type
checking rules.

Table 26 Type Checking Rules[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#type-information-for-instructions-and-operands-type-checking-rules "Permalink to this table")








|  | | **Operand Type** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | **.bX** | **.sX** | **.uX** | **.fX** |
| **Instruction Type** | **.bX** | okay | okay | okay | okay |
| **.sX** | okay | okay | okay | invalid |
| **.uX** | okay | okay | okay | invalid |
| **.fX** | okay | invalid | invalid | okay |

Note

Some operands have their type and size defined independently from the instruction type-size. For
example, the shift amount operand for left and right shift instructions always has type `.u32`,
while the remaining operands have their type and size determined by the instruction type.

Example

```
// 64-bit arithmetic right shift; shift amount 'b' is .u32
    shr.s64 d,a,b;
```
