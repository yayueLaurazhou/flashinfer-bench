New Features

PTX ISA version 6.4 introduces the following new features:

* Adds support for `.noreturn` directive which can be used to indicate a function does not return
  to it’s caller function.
* Adds support for `mma` instruction which allows performing matrix multiply-and-accumulate
  operation.

Deprecated Features

PTX ISA version 6.4 deprecates the following features:

* Support for `.satfinite` qualifier on floating point `wmma.mma` instruction.

Removed Features

PTX ISA version 6.4 removes the following features:

* Support for `shfl` and `vote` instructions without the `.sync` qualifier has been removed
  for `.target``sm_70` and higher. This support was deprecated since PTX ISA version 6.0 as
  documented in PTX ISA version 6.2.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

* Clarified that resolving references of a `.weak` symbol considers only `.weak` or `.visible`
  symbols with the same name and does not consider local symbols with the same name.
* Clarified that in `cvt` instruction, modifier `.ftz` can only be specified when either
  `.atype` or `.dtype` is `.f32`.
