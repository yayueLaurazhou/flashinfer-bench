New Features

Floating Point Extensions

This section describes the floating-point changes in PTX ISA version 2.0 for `sm_20` targets. The
goal is to achieve IEEE 754 compliance wherever possible, while maximizing backward compatibility
with legacy PTX ISA version 1.x code and `sm_1x` targets.

The changes from PTX ISA version 1.x are as follows:

* Single-precision instructions support subnormal numbers by default for `sm_20` targets. The
  `.ftz` modifier may be used to enforce backward compatibility with `sm_1x`.
* Single-precision `add`, `sub`, and `mul` now support `.rm` and `.rp` rounding modifiers
  for `sm_20` targets.
* A single-precision fused multiply-add (fma) instruction has been added, with support for IEEE 754
  compliant rounding modifiers and support for subnormal numbers. The `fma.f32` instruction also
  supports `.ftz` and `.sat` modifiers. `fma.f32` requires `sm_20`. The `mad.f32`
  instruction has been extended with rounding modifiers so that it’s synonymous with `fma.f32`
  for `sm_20` targets. Both `fma.f32` and `mad.f32` require a rounding modifier for `sm_20`
  targets.
* The `mad.f32` instruction *without rounding* is retained so that compilers can generate code for
  `sm_1x` targets. When code compiled for `sm_1x` is executed on `sm_20` devices, `mad.f32`
  maps to `fma.rn.f32`.
* Single- and double-precision `div`, `rcp`, and `sqrt` with IEEE 754 compliant rounding have
  been added. These are indicated by the use of a rounding modifier and require `sm_20`.
* Instructions `testp` and `copysign` have been added.

New Instructions

A *load uniform* instruction, `ldu`, has been added.

Surface instructions support additional `.clamp` modifiers, `.clamp` and `.zero`.

Instruction `sust` now supports formatted surface stores.

A *count leading zeros* instruction, `clz`, has been added.

A *find leading non-sign bit instruction*, `bfind`, has been added.

A *bit reversal* instruction, `brev`, has been added.

Bit field extract and insert instructions, `bfe` and `bfi`, have been added.

A *population count* instruction, `popc`, has been added.

A *vote ballot* instruction, `vote.ballot.b32`, has been added.

Instructions `{atom,red}.add.f32` have been implemented.

Instructions `{atom,red}`.shared have been extended to handle 64-bit data types for `sm_20`
targets.

A system-level membar instruction, `membar.sys`, has been added.

The `bar` instruction has been extended as follows:

* A `bar.arrive` instruction has been added.
* Instructions `bar.red.popc.u32` and `bar.red.{and,or}.pred` have been added.
* `bar` now supports optional thread count and register operands.

Scalar video instructions (includes `prmt`) have been added.

Instruction `isspacep` for querying whether a generic address falls within a specified state space
window has been added.

Instruction `cvta` for converting global, local, and shared addresses to generic address and
vice-versa has been added.

Other New Features

Instructions `ld`, `ldu`, `st`, `prefetch`, `prefetchu`, `isspacep`, `cvta`, `atom`,
and `red` now support generic addressing.

New special registers `%nwarpid`, `%nsmid`, `%clock64`, `%lanemask_{eq,le,lt,ge,gt}` have
been added.

Cache operations have been added to instructions `ld`, `st`, `suld`, and `sust`, e.g., for
`prefetching` to specified level of memory hierarchy. Instructions `prefetch` and `prefetchu`
have also been added.

The `.maxnctapersm` directive was deprecated and replaced with `.minnctapersm` to better match
its behavior and usage.

A new directive, `.section`, has been added to replace the `@@DWARF` syntax for passing
DWARF-format debugging information through PTX.

A new directive, `.pragma nounroll`, has been added to allow users to disable loop unrolling.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The errata in `cvt.ftz` for PTX ISA versions 1.4 and earlier, where single-precision subnormal
inputs and results were not flushed to zero if either source or destination type size was 64-bits,
has been fixed. In PTX ISA version 1.5 and later, `cvt.ftz` (and `cvt` for `.target sm_1x`,
where `.ftz` is implied) instructions flush single-precision subnormal inputs and results to
sign-preserving zero for all combinations of floating-point instruction types. To maintain
compatibility with legacy PTX code, if .version is 1.4 or earlier, single-precision subnormal inputs
and results are flushed to sign-preserving zero only when neither source nor destination type size
is 64-bits.

Components of special registers `%tid`, `%ntid`, `%ctaid`, and `%nctaid` have been extended
from 16-bits to 32-bits. These registers now have type `.v4.u32`.

The number of samplers available in independent texturing mode was incorrectly listed as thirty-two
in PTX ISA version 1.5; the correct number is sixteen.
