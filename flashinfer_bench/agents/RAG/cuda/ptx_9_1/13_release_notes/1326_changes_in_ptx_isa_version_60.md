## 13.26. [Changes in PTX ISA Version 6.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-0)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#changes-in-ptx-isa-version-6-0 "Permalink to this headline")

New Features

PTX ISA version 6.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_70` target architecture.
* Specifies the memory consistency model for programs running on `sm_70` and later architectures.
* Various extensions to memory instructions to specify memory synchronization semantics and scopes
  at which such synchronization can be observed.
* New instruction `wmma` for matrix operations which allows loading matrices from memory,
  performing multiply-and-accumulate on them and storing result in memory.
* Support for new `barrier` instruction.
* Extends `neg` instruction to support `.f16` and `.f16x2` types.
* A new instruction `fns` which allows finding n-th set bit in integer.
* A new instruction `bar.warp.sync` which allows synchronizing threads in warp.
* Extends `vote` and `shfl` instructions with `.sync` modifier which waits for specified
  threads before executing the `vote` and `shfl` operation respectively.
* A new instruction `match.sync` which allows broadcasting and comparing a value across threads in
  warp.
* A new instruction `brx.idx` which allows branching to a label indexed from list of potential
  targets.
* Support for unsized array parameter for `.func` which can be used to implement variadic
  functions.
* Support for `.b16` integer type in dwarf-lines.
* Support for taking address of device function return parameters using `mov` instruction.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

* Semantics of `bar` instruction were updated to indicate that executing thread waits for other
  non-exited threads from it’s warp.
* Support for indirect branch introduced in PTX 2.1 which was unimplemented has been removed from
  the spec.
* Support for taking address of labels, using labels in initializers which was unimplemented has
  been removed from the spec.
* Support for variadic functions which was unimplemented has been removed from the spec.
