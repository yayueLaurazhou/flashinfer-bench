# 10.4. Special Registers: %warpid

`%warpid`

Warp identifier.

Syntax (predefined)

```
.sreg .u32 %warpid;
```

Description

A predefined, read-only special register that returns the thread’s warp identifier. The warp
identifier provides a unique warp number within a CTA but not across CTAs within a grid. The warp
identifier will be the same for all threads within a single warp.

Note that `%warpid` returns the location of a thread at the moment when read, but
its value may change during execution, e.g., due to rescheduling of threads following
preemption. For this reason, `%ctaid` and `%tid` should be used to compute a virtual warp index
if such a value is needed in kernel code; `%warpid` is intended mainly to enable profiling and
diagnostic code to sample and log information such as work place mapping and load distribution.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.3.
