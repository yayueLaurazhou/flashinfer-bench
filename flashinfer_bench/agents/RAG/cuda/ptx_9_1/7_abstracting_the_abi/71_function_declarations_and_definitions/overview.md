# 7.1. Function Declarations and Definitions

## 7.1. [Function Declarations and Definitions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#function-declarations-and-definitions)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#function-declarations-and-definitions "Permalink to this headline")

In PTX, functions are declared and defined using the `.func` directive. A function *declaration*
specifies an optional list of return parameters, the function name, and an optional list of input
parameters; together these specify the function’s interface, or prototype. A function *definition*
specifies both the interface and the body of the function. A function must be declared or defined
prior to being called.

The simplest function has no parameters or return values, and is represented in PTX as follows:

```
.func foo
{
    ...
    ret;
}

    ...
    call foo;
    ...
```

Here, execution of the `call` instruction transfers control to `foo`, implicitly saving the
return address. Execution of the `ret` instruction within `foo` transfers control to the
instruction following the call.

Scalar and vector base-type input and return parameters may be represented simply as register
variables. At the call, arguments may be register variables or constants, and return values may be
placed directly into register variables. The arguments and return variables at the call must have
type and size that match the callee’s corresponding formal parameters.

Example

```
.func (.reg .u32 %res) inc_ptr ( .reg .u32 %ptr, .reg .u32 %inc )
{
    add.u32 %res, %ptr, %inc;
    ret;
}

    ...
    call (%r1), inc_ptr, (%r1,4);
    ...
```

When using the ABI, `.reg` state space parameters must be at least 32-bits in size. Subword scalar
objects in the source language should be promoted to 32-bit registers in PTX, or use `.param`
state space byte arrays described next.

Objects such as C structures and unions are flattened into registers or byte arrays in PTX and are
represented using `.param` space memory. For example, consider the following C structure, passed
by value to a function:

```
struct {
    double dbl;
    char   c[4];
};
```

In PTX, this structure will be flattened into a byte array. Since memory accesses are required to be
aligned to a multiple of the access size, the structure in this example will be a 12 byte array with
8 byte alignment so that accesses to the `.f64` field are aligned. The `.param` state space is
used to pass the structure by value:

Example

```
.func (.reg .s32 out) bar (.reg .s32 x, .param .align 8 .b8 y[12])
{
    .reg .f64 f1;
    .reg .b32 c1, c2, c3, c4;
    ...
    ld.param.f64 f1, [y+0];
    ld.param.b8  c1, [y+8];
    ld.param.b8  c2, [y+9];
    ld.param.b8  c3, [y+10];
    ld.param.b8  c4, [y+11];
    ...
    ... // computation using x,f1,c1,c2,c3,c4;
}

{
     .param .b8 .align 8 py[12];
     ...
     st.param.b64 [py+ 0], %rd;
     st.param.b8  [py+ 8], %rc1;
     st.param.b8  [py+ 9], %rc2;
     st.param.b8  [py+10], %rc1;
     st.param.b8  [py+11], %rc2;
     // scalar args in .reg space, byte array in .param space
     call (%out), bar, (%x, py);
     ...
```

In this example, note that `.param` space variables are used in two ways. First, a `.param`
variable `y` is used in function definition bar to represent a formal parameter. Second, a
`.param` variable `py` is declared in the body of the calling function and used to set up the
structure being passed to bar.

The following is a conceptual way to think about the `.param` state space use in device functions.

For a caller,

* The `.param` state space is used to set values that will be passed to a called function and/or
  to receive return values from a called function. Typically, a `.param` byte array is used to
  collect together fields of a structure being passed by value.

For a callee,

* The `.param` state space is used to receive parameter values and/or pass return values back to
  the caller.

The following restrictions apply to parameter passing.

For a caller,

* Arguments may be `.param` variables, `.reg` variables, or constants.
* In the case of `.param` space formal parameters that are byte arrays, the argument must also be
  a `.param` space byte array with matching type, size, and alignment. A `.param` argument must
  be declared within the local scope of the caller.
* In the case of `.param` space formal parameters that are base-type scalar or vector variables,
  the corresponding argument may be either a `.param` or `.reg` space variable with matching
  type and size, or a constant that can be represented in the type of the formal parameter.
* In the case of `.reg` space formal parameters, the corresponding argument may be either a
  `.param` or `.reg` space variable of matching type and size, or a constant that can be
  represented in the type of the formal parameter.
* In the case of `.reg` space formal parameters, the register must be at least 32-bits in size.
* All `st.param` instructions used for passing arguments to function call must immediately precede
  the corresponding `call` instruction and `ld.param` instruction used for collecting return
  value must immediately follow the `call` instruction without any control flow
  alteration. `st.param` and `ld.param` instructions used for argument passing cannot be
  predicated. This enables compiler optimization and ensures that the `.param` variable does not
  consume extra space in the caller’s frame beyond that needed by the ABI. The `.param` variable
  simply allows a mapping to be made at the call site between data that may be in multiple
  locations (e.g., structure being manipulated by caller is located in registers and memory) to
  something that can be passed as a parameter or return value to the callee.

For a callee,

* Input and return parameters may be `.param` variables or `.reg` variables.
* Parameters in `.param` memory must be aligned to a multiple of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes.
* Parameters in the `.reg` state space must be at least 32-bits in size.
* The `.reg` state space can be used to receive and return base-type scalar and vector values,
  including sub-word size objects when compiling in non-ABI mode. Supporting the `.reg` state
  space provides legacy support.

Note that the choice of `.reg` or `.param` state space for parameter passing has no impact on
whether the parameter is ultimately passed in physical registers or on the stack. The mapping of
parameters to physical registers and stack locations depends on the ABI definition and the order,
size, and alignment of parameters.
