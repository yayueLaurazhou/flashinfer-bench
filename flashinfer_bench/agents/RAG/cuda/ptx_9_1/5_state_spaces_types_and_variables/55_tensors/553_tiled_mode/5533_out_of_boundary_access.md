# 5.5.3.3. Out of Boundary Access

#### 5.5.3.3. [Out of Boundary Access](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tiled-mode-oob-access)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-tiled-mode-oob-access "Permalink to this headline")

PTX Tensor operation can detect and handle the case when the Bounding Box crosses the tensor
boundary in any dimension. There are 2 modes:

* Zero fill mode:

  Elements in the Bounding Box which fall outside of the tensor boundary are set to 0.
* `OOB-NaN` fill mode:

  Elements in the Bounding Box which fall outside of the tensor boundary are set to a special NaN
  called `OOB-NaN`.

[Figure 9](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-oob-access) shows an example of the out of boundary access.
