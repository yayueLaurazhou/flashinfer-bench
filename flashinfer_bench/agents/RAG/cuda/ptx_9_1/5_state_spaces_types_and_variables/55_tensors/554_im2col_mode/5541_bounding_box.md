# 5.5.4.1. Bounding Box

#### 5.5.4.1. [Bounding Box](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-mode-bounding-box)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-mode-bounding-box "Permalink to this headline")

In im2col mode, the Bounding Box is defined in DHW space. Boundaries along other dimensions are
specified by Pixels-per-Column and Channels-per-Pixel parameters as described below.

The dimensionality of the Bounding Box is two less than the tensor dimensionality.

The following properties describe how to access of the elements in im2col mode:

* Bounding-Box Lower-Corner
* Bounding-Box Upper-Corner
* Pixels-per-Column
* Channels-per-Pixel

*Bounding-box Lower-Corner* and *Bounding-box Upper-Corner* specify the two opposite corners of the
Bounding Box in the DHW space. *Bounding-box Lower-Corner* specifies the corner with the smallest
coordinate and *Bounding-box Upper-Corner* specifies the corner with the largest coordinate.

*Bounding-box Upper-* and *Lower-Corners* are 16-bit signed values whose limits varies across the
dimensions and are as shown below:

|  | 3D | 4D | 5D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper- / Lower- Corner sizes | [-215, 215-1] | [-27, 27-1] | [-24, 24-1] |

[Figure 11](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#im2col-mode-bounding-box1) and [Figure 12](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#im2col-mode-bounding-box2) show the Upper-Corners and Lower-Corners.

The *Bounding-box Upper-* and *Lower- Corners* specify only the boundaries and not the number of
elements to be accessed. *Pixels-per-Column* specifies the number of elements to be accessed in the
NDHW space.

*Channels-per-Pixel* specifies the number of elements to access across the C dimension.

The tensor coordinates, specified in the PTX tensor instructions, behaves differently in different
dimensions:

* Across N and C dimensions: specify the starting offsets along the dimension, similar to the tiled
  mode.
* Across DHW dimensions: specify the location of the convolution filter base in the tensor
  space. The filter corner location must be within the bounding box.

The im2col offsets, specified in the PTX tensor instructions in im2col mode, are added to the filter
base coordinates to determine the starting location in the tensor space from where the elements are
accessed.

The size of the im2col offsets varies across the dimensions and their valid ranges are as shown
below:

|  | 3D | 4D | 5D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| im2col offsets range | [0, 216-1] | [0, 28-1] | [0, 25-1] |

Following are some examples of the im2col mode accesses:

* Example 1 ([Figure 13](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-mode-example1)):

  ```
  Tensor Size[0] = 64
  Tensor Size[1] = 9
  Tensor Size[2] = 14
  Tensor Size[3] = 64
  Pixels-per-Column = 64
  channels-per-pixel = 8
  Bounding-Box Lower-Corner W = -1
  Bounding-Box Lower-Corner H = -1
  Bounding-Box Upper-Corner W = -1
  Bounding-Box Upper-Corner H = -1.

  tensor coordinates = (7, 7, 4, 0)
  im2col offsets : (0, 0)
  ```
