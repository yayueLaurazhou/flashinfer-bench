# 5.5.5.3. wHalo

#### 5.5.5.3. [`wHalo`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-whalo)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-whalo "Permalink to this headline")

In `im2col::w` mode, the `wHalo` argument in the PTX instruction specifies how many filter
halo elements must be loaded at the end of the image.

In `im2col::w::128` mode, the halo elements are loaded after every 32 elements in the bounding
box along the `W` dimension. The `wHalo` argument in the PTX instruction specifies how many
halo elements must be loaded after every 32 elements.

Following is an example of `.im2col::w` mode access:

```
Tensor Size [0] = 128
Tensor Size [1] = 9
Tensor Size [2] = 7
Tensor Size [3] = 64
Pixels-per-column = 128
Channels-per-pixel = 64
Bounding Box Lower Corner W = 0
Bounding Box Upper Corner W = 0

Tensor Coordinates in the instruction = (7, 2, 3, 0)
wHalo in the instruction = 2 (as 3x3 convolution filter is used)
```

A tensor copy operation with the above parameters loads 128 pixels and the two halo pixels as shown in
[Figure 18](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-example3).

The halo pixels are always loaded in the shared memory next to the main row pixels as shown in
[Figure 18](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-example3).

Following is an example of `.im2col::w::128` mode access:

```
Tensor Size [0] = 128
Tensor Size [1] = 9
Tensor Size [2] = 7
Tensor Size [3] = 64
Channels-per-pixel = 64
Bounding Box Lower Corner W = 0
Bounding Box Upper Corner W = 0

Tensor Coordinates in the instruction = (7, 2, 3, 0)
wHalo in the instruction = 2 (as 3x3 convolution filter is used)

A tensor copy operation with the above parameters loads 128 elements such that after every 32 elements,
wHalo number of elements are loaded as shown in [Figure 19](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-example4).
