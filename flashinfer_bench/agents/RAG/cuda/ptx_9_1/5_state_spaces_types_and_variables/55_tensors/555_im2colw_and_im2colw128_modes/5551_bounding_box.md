# 5.5.5.1. Bounding Box

#### 5.5.5.1. [Bounding Box](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-bounding-box)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-bounding-box "Permalink to this headline")

In these modes, the size of the bounding box in `D` and `H` dimensions are 1.

The `D` and `H` dimensions in the tensor coordinates argument in the PTX instruction specify
the position of the bounding box in the tensor space.

The Bounding-Box `Lower-Corner-W` and Bounding-Box `Upper-Corner-W` specify the two opposite
corners of the Bounding Box in the `W` dimension.

The `W` dimension in the tensor coordinates argument in the PTX instruction specify the location
of the first element that is to be accessed in the bounding box.

Number of pixels loaded in `im2col::w` mode is as specified by Pixels-per-Column in the TensorMap.
Number of pixels loaded in `im2col::w::128` mode is always 128. So, Pixels-per-Column is ignored
in `im2col::w::128` mode.

[Figure 16](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-example) shows an example of the `im2col::w` and
`im2col::w:128` modes.

The first element can lie outside of the Bounding Box in the W-dimension only and only on the left
side of the Bounding Box. [Figure 17](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tensor-im2col-w-w128-modes-example2) shows of an example of this.
