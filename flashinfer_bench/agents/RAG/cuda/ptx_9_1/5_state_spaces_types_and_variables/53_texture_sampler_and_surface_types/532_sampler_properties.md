# 5.3.2. Sampler Properties

### 5.3.2. [Sampler Properties](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#sampler-properties)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#sampler-properties "Permalink to this headline")

The `normalized_coords` field indicates whether the texture or surface uses normalized coordinates
in the range [0.0, 1.0) instead of unnormalized coordinates in the range [0, N). If no value is
specified, the default is set by the runtime system based on the source language.

The `filter_mode` field specifies how the values returned by texture reads are computed based on
the input texture coordinates.

The `addr_mode_{0,1,2}` fields define the addressing mode in each dimension, which determine how
out-of-range coordinates are handled.

See the *CUDA C++ Programming Guide* for more details of these properties.

In independent texture mode, the sampler properties are carried in an independent `.samplerref`
variable, and these fields are disabled in the `.texref` variables. One additional sampler
property, `force_unnormalized_coords`, is available in independent texture mode.

The `force_unnormalized_coords` field is a property of `.samplerref` variables that allows the
sampler to override the texture header `normalized_coords` property. This field is defined only in
independent texture mode. When `True`, the texture header setting is overridden and unnormalized
coordinates are used; when `False`, the texture header setting is used.

The `force_unnormalized_coords` property is used in compiling OpenCL; in OpenCL, the property of
normalized coordinates is carried in sampler headers. To compile OpenCL to PTX, texture headers are
always initialized with `normalized_coords` set to True, and the OpenCL sampler-based
`normalized_coords` flag maps (negated) to the PTX-level `force_unnormalized_coords` flag.

Variables using these types may be declared at module scope or within kernel entry parameter
lists. At module scope, these variables must be in the `.global` state space. As kernel
parameters, these variables are declared in the `.param` state space.

Example

```
.global .texref     my_texture_name;
.global .samplerref my_sampler_name;
.global .surfref    my_surface_name;
```

When declared at module scope, the types may be initialized using a list of static expressions
assigning values to the named members.

Example

```
.global .texref tex1;
.global .samplerref tsamp1 = { addr_mode_0 = clamp_to_border,
                               filter_mode = nearest
                             };
```
