# 5.3. Texture Sampler and Surface Types

## 5.3. [Texture Sampler and Surface Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#texture-sampler-and-surface-types)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#texture-sampler-and-surface-types "Permalink to this headline")

PTX includes built-in *opaque* types for defining texture, sampler, and surface descriptor
variables. These types have named fields similar to structures, but all information about layout,
field ordering, base address, and overall size is hidden to a PTX program, hence the term
*opaque*. The use of these opaque types is limited to:

* Variable definition within global (module) scope and in kernel entry parameter lists.
* Static initialization of module-scope variables using comma-delimited static assignment
  expressions for the named members of the type.
* Referencing textures, samplers, or surfaces via texture and surface load/store instructions
  (`tex`, `suld`, `sust`, `sured`).
* Retrieving the value of a named member via query instructions (`txq`, `suq`).
* Creating pointers to opaque variables using `mov`, e.g., `mov.u64 reg, opaque_var;`. The
  resulting pointer may be stored to and loaded from memory, passed as a parameter to functions, and
  de-referenced by texture and surface load, store, and query instructions, but the pointer cannot
  otherwise be treated as an address, i.e., accessing the pointer with `ld` and `st`
  instructions, or performing pointer arithmetic will result in undefined results.
* Opaque variables may not appear in initializers, e.g., to initialize a pointer to an opaque
  variable.

Note

Indirect access to textures and surfaces using pointers to opaque variables is supported
beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1 and requires target `sm_20` or later.

Indirect access to textures is supported only in unified texture mode (see below).

The three built-in types are `.texref`, `.samplerref`, and `.surfref`. For working with
textures and samplers, PTX has two modes of operation. In the *unified mode,* texture and sampler
information is accessed through a single `.texref` handle. In the *independent mode*, texture and
sampler information each have their own handle, allowing them to be defined separately and combined
at the site of usage in the program. In independent mode, the fields of the `.texref` type that
describe sampler properties are ignored, since these properties are defined by `.samplerref`
variables.

[Table 10](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#texture-sampler-and-surface-types-opaque-type-fields-in-unified-texture-mode) and
[Table 11](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#sampler-properties-opaque-type-fields-in-independent-texture-mode) list the named members
of each type for unified and independent texture modes. These members and their values have
precise mappings to methods and values defined in the texture `HW` class as well as
exposed values via the API.
