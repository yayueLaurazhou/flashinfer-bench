# 5.2.1. Fundamental Types

### 5.2.1. [Fundamental Types](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#fundamental-types)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#fundamental-types "Permalink to this headline")

In PTX, the fundamental types reflect the native data types supported by the target architectures. A
fundamental type specifies both a basic type and a size. Register variables are always of a
fundamental type, and instructions operate on these types. The same type-size specifiers are used
for both variable definitions and for typing instructions, so their names are intentionally short.

[Table 8](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#fundamental-types-fundamental-type-specifiers) lists the fundamental type specifiers for
each basic type:

Table 8 Fundamental Type Specifiers[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#fundamental-types-fundamental-type-specifiers "Permalink to this table")




| Basic Type | Fundamental Type Specifiers |
| --- | --- |
| Signed integer | `.s8`, `.s16`, `.s32`, `.s64` |
| Unsigned integer | `.u8`, `.u16`, `.u32`, `.u64` |
| Floating-point | `.f16`, `.f16x2`, `.f32`, `.f64` |
| Bits (untyped) | `.b8`, `.b16`, `.b32`, `.b64`, `.b128` |
| Predicate | `.pred` |

Most instructions have one or more type specifiers, needed to fully specify instruction
behavior. Operand types and sizes are checked against instruction types for compatibility.

Two fundamental types are compatible if they have the same basic type and are the same size. Signed
and unsigned integer types are compatible if they have the same size. The bit-size type is
compatible with any fundamental type having the same size.

In principle, all variables (aside from predicates) could be declared using only bit-size types, but
typed variables enhance program readability and allow for better operand type checking.
