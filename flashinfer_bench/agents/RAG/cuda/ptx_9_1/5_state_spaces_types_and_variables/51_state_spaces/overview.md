# 5.1. State Spaces

## 5.1. [State Spaces](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#state-spaces)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#state-spaces "Permalink to this headline")

A state space is a storage area with particular characteristics. All variables reside in some state
space. The characteristics of a state space include its size, addressability, access speed, access
rights, and level of sharing between threads.

The state spaces defined in PTX are a byproduct of parallel programming and graphics
programming. The list of state spaces is shown in [Table 6](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#state-spaces-state-spaces-tab),and
properties of state spaces are shown in [Table 7](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#state-spaces-properties-state-spaces).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.reg` | Registers, fast. |
| `.sreg` | Special registers. Read-only; pre-defined; platform-specific. |
| `.const` | Shared, read-only memory. |
| `.global` | Global memory, shared by all threads. |
| `.local` | Local memory, private to each thread. |
| `.param` | Kernel parameters, defined per-grid; or  Function or local parameters, defined per-thread. |
| `.shared` | Addressable memory, defined per CTA, accessible to all threads in the cluster throughout the lifetime of the CTA that defines it. |
| `.tex` | Global texture memory (deprecated). |

| Name | Addressable | Initializable | Access | Sharing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.reg` | No | No | R/W | per-thread |
| `.sreg` | No | No | RO | per-CTA |
| `.const` | Yes | Yes1 | RO | per-grid |
| `.global` | Yes | Yes1 | R/W | Context |
| `.local` | Yes | No | R/W | per-thread |
| `.param` (as input to kernel) | Yes2 | No | RO | per-grid |
| `.param` (used in functions) | Restricted3 | No | R/W | per-thread |
| `.shared` | Yes | No | R/W | per-cluster5 |
| `.tex` | No4 | Yes, via driver | RO | Context |
| **Notes:**  1 Variables in `.const` and `.global` state spaces are initialized to zero by default.  2 Accessible only via the `ld.param{::entry}` instruction. Address may be taken via `mov` instruction.  3 Accessible via `ld.param{::func}` and `st.param{::func}` instructions. Device function input and return parameters may have their address taken via `mov`; the parameter is then located on the stack frame and its address is in the `.local` state space.  4 Accessible only via the `tex` instruction.  5 Visible to the owning CTA and other active CTAs in the cluster. | | | | |
