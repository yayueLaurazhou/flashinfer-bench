# 5.4.6. Parameterized Variable Names

### 5.4.6. [Parameterized Variable Names](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parameterized-variable-names)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parameterized-variable-names "Permalink to this headline")

Since PTX supports virtual registers, it is quite common for a compiler frontend to generate a large
number of register names. Rather than require explicit declaration of every name, PTX supports a
syntax for creating a set of variables having a common prefix string appended with integer suffixes.

For example, suppose a program uses a large number, say one hundred, of `.b32` variables, named
`%r0`, `%r1`, …, `%r99`. These 100 register variables can be declared as follows:

```
.reg .b32 %r<100>;    // declare %r0, %r1, ..., %r99
```

This shorthand syntax may be used with any of the fundamental types and with any state space, and
may be preceded by an alignment specifier. Array variables cannot be declared this way, nor are
initializers permitted.
