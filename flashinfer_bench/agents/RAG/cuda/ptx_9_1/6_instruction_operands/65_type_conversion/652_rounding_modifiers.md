# 6.5.2. Rounding Modifiers

### 6.5.2. [Rounding Modifiers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#rounding-modifiers)[](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#rounding-modifiers "Permalink to this headline")

Conversion instructions may specify a rounding modifier. In PTX, there are four integer rounding
modifiers and six floating-point rounding
modifiers. [Table 17](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#rounding-modifiers-floating-point-rounding-modifiers) and
[Table 18](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#rounding-modifiers-integer-rounding-modifiers) summarize the rounding modifiers.

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.rn` | rounds to nearest even |
| `.rna` | rounds to nearest, ties away from zero |
| `.rz` | rounds towards zero |
| `.rm` | rounds towards negative infinity |
| `.rp` | rounds towards positive infinity |
| `.rs` | rounds either towards zero or away from zero based on the carry out of the integer addition of random bits and the discarded bits of mantissa |

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.rni` | round to nearest integer, choosing even integer if source is equidistant between two integers. |
| `.rzi` | round to nearest integer in the direction of zero |
| `.rmi` | round to nearest integer in direction of negative infinity |
| `.rpi` | round to nearest integer in direction of positive infinity |
