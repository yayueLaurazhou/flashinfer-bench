##### CUresult cuD3D9MapResources (unsigned int count, IDirect3DResource9 **ppResource)

Map Direct3D resources for access by CUDA.

###### Parameters

**count**

  - Number of resources in ppResource
**ppResource**

  - Resources to map for CUDA usage


CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  619


Modules

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE,
CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED, CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Maps the count Direct3D resources in ppResource for access by CUDA.

The resources in ppResource may be accessed in CUDA kernels until they are unmapped. Direct3D
should not access any resources while they are mapped by CUDA. If an application does so the results
are undefined.

This function provides the synchronization guarantee that any Direct3D calls issued before
cuD3D9MapResources() will complete before any CUDA kernels issued after cuD3D9MapResources()
begin.

If any of ppResource have not been registered for use with CUDA or if ppResource contains any
duplicate entries, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If any of ppResource are
presently mapped for access by CUDA, then CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED is returned.


Note:


Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

##### CUresult cuD3D9RegisterResource (IDirect3DResource9 *pResource, unsigned int Flags)

Register a Direct3D resource for access by CUDA.

###### Parameters

**pResource**

  - Resource to register for CUDA access
**Flags**

  - Flags for resource registration

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE,

Modules


CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY,
CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Registers the Direct3D resource pResource for access by CUDA.

If this call is successful, then the application will be able to map and unmap this resource until it is
unregistered through cuD3D9UnregisterResource(). Also on success, this call will increase the internal
reference count on pResource. This reference count will be decremented when this resource is
unregistered through cuD3D9UnregisterResource().

This call is potentially high-overhead and should not be called every frame in interactive applications.

The type of pResource must be one of the following.

IDirect3DVertexBuffer9: Cannot be used with set to

###### ‣ Flags

CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_ARRAY.
IDirect3DIndexBuffer9: Cannot be used with set to

###### ‣ Flags

CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_ARRAY.
IDirect3DSurface9: Only stand-alone objects of type IDirect3DSurface9 may be explicitly shared.

###### **‣**

In particular, individual mipmap levels and faces of cube maps may not be registered directly. To
access individual surfaces associated with a texture, one must register the base texture object. For
restrictions on the Flags parameter, see type IDirect3DBaseTexture9.
IDirect3DBaseTexture9: When a texture is registered, all surfaces associated with the all mipmap

###### **‣**

levels of all faces of the texture will be accessible to CUDA.

The Flags argument specifies the mechanism through which CUDA will access the Direct3D
resource. The following values are allowed.

CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_NONE: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource through a

###### **‣**

CUdeviceptr. The pointer, size, and (for textures), pitch for each subresource of this allocation may
be queried through cuD3D9ResourceGetMappedPointer(), cuD3D9ResourceGetMappedSize(), and
cuD3D9ResourceGetMappedPitch() respectively. This option is valid for all resource types.
CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_ARRAY: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource

###### **‣**

through a CUarray queried on a sub-resource basis through cuD3D9ResourceGetMappedArray().
This option is only valid for resources of type IDirect3DSurface9 and subtypes of
IDirect3DBaseTexture9.

Not all Direct3D resources of the above types may be used for interoperability with CUDA. The
following are some limitations.

The primary rendertarget may not be registered with CUDA.

###### **‣**

Resources allocated as shared may not be registered with CUDA.

###### **‣**

Any resources allocated in D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM or D3DPOOL_MANAGED may not be

###### **‣**

registered with CUDA.


CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  621


Modules


Textures which are not of a format which is 1, 2, or 4 channels of 8, 16, or 32-bit integer or

###### **‣**

floating-point data cannot be shared.
Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.

###### **‣**

If Direct3D interoperability is not initialized on this context, then
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is returned. If pResource is of incorrect type (e.g. is a nonstand-alone IDirect3DSurface9) or is already registered, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is
returned. If pResource cannot be registered then CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN is returned.


Note:


Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  623


Modules


Returns in *pPitch and *pPitchSlice the pitch and Z-slice pitch of the subresource of the
mapped Direct3D resource pResource, which corresponds to Face and Level. The values set in
pPitch and pPitchSlice may change every time that pResource is mapped.

The pitch and Z-slice pitch values may be used to compute the location of a sample on a surface as
follows.

For a 2D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position x, y from the base pointer of the surface is:

y * pitch + (bytes per pixel) * x

For a 3D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position x, y, z from the base pointer of the surface is:

z* slicePitch + y * pitch + (bytes per pixel) * x

Both parameters pPitch and pPitchSlice are optional and may be set to NULL.

If pResource is not of type IDirect3DBaseTexture9 or one of its sub-types or if pResource
has not been registered for use with CUDA, then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If
pResource was not registered with usage flags CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_NONE, then
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If pResource is not mapped for access by
CUDA then CUDA_ERROR_NOT_MAPPED is returned.

time that pResource is mapped.

If pResource is not registered, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If
pResource was not registered with usage flags CU_D3D9_REGISTER_FLAGS_NONE,
then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If pResource is not mapped, then
CUDA_ERROR_NOT_MAPPED is returned.

If pResource is of type IDirect3DCubeTexture9, then Face must one of the values enumerated
by type D3DCUBEMAP_FACES. For all other types Face must be 0. If Face is invalid, then

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Returns in *pWidth, *pHeight, and *pDepth the dimensions of the subresource of the mapped
Direct3D resource pResource, which corresponds to Face and Level.

Because anti-aliased surfaces may have multiple samples per pixel, it is possible that the dimensions of
a resource will be an integer factor larger than the dimensions reported by the Direct3D runtime.

The parameters pWidth, pHeight, and pDepth are optional. For 2D surfaces, the value returned in
*pDepth will be 0.

If pResource is not of type IDirect3DBaseTexture9 or IDirect3DSurface9 or if pResource has not
been registered for use with CUDA, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned.

Changes to Flags will take effect the next time pResource is mapped. The Flags argument may
be any of the following:

CU_D3D9_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_NONE: Specifies no hints about how this resource will be

###### **‣**

used. It is therefore assumed that this resource will be read from and written to by CUDA kernels.
This is the default value.
CU_D3D9_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_READONLY: Specifies that CUDA kernels which access

###### **‣**

this resource will not write to this resource.
CU_D3D9_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_WRITEDISCARD: Specifies that CUDA kernels which

###### **‣**

access this resource will not read from this resource and will write over the entire contents of the
resource, so none of the data previously stored in the resource will be preserved.

If pResource has not been registered for use with CUDA, then
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If pResource is presently mapped for access by
CUDA, then CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED is returned.
