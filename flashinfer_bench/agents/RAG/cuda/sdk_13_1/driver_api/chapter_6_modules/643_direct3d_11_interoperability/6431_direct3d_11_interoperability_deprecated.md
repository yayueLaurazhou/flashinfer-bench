# 6.43.1. Direct3D 11 Interoperability [DEPRECATED]

Direct3D 11 Interoperability

This section describes deprecated Direct3D 11 interoperability functionality.

##### CUresult cuD3D11CtxCreate (CUcontext *pCtx, CUdevice *pCudaDevice, unsigned int Flags, ID3D11Device *pD3DDevice)

Create a CUDA context for interoperability with Direct3D 11.

###### Parameters

**pCtx**

  - Returned newly created CUDA context
**pCudaDevice**

  - Returned pointer to the device on which the context was created
**Flags**

  - Context creation flags (see cuCtxCreate() for details)
**pD3DDevice**

  - Direct3D device to create interoperability context with

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY,
CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 5.0.

This function is deprecated and should no longer be used. It is no longer necessary to associate a
CUDA context with a D3D11 device in order to achieve maximum interoperability performance.


Note:


Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Modules

##### CUresult cuD3D11CtxCreateOnDevice (CUcontext *pCtx, unsigned int flags, ID3D11Device *pD3DDevice, CUdevice cudaDevice)

Create a CUDA context for interoperability with Direct3D 11.

###### Parameters

**pCtx**

  - Returned newly created CUDA context
**flags**

  - Context creation flags (see cuCtxCreate() for details)
**pD3DDevice**

  - Direct3D device to create interoperability context with
**cudaDevice**

  - The CUDA device on which to create the context. This device must be among the devices returned
when querying CU_D3D11_DEVICES_ALL from cuD3D11GetDevices.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY,
CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

Modules

##### CUresult cuD3D11GetDirect3DDevice (ID3D11Device **ppD3DDevice)

Get the Direct3D 11 device against which the current CUDA context was created.

###### Parameters

**ppD3DDevice**

  - Returned Direct3D device corresponding to CUDA context

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT
