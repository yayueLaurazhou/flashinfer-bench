##### CUresult cuD3D10MapResources (unsigned int count, ID3D10Resource **ppResources)

Map Direct3D resources for access by CUDA.

###### Parameters

**count**

  - Number of resources to map for CUDA
**ppResources**

  - Resources to map for CUDA

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE,
CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED, CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Maps the count Direct3D resources in ppResources for access by CUDA.

The resources in ppResources may be accessed in CUDA kernels until they are unmapped.
Direct3D should not access any resources while they are mapped by CUDA. If an application does so,
the results are undefined.

This function provides the synchronization guarantee that any Direct3D calls issued
before cuD3D10MapResources() will complete before any CUDA kernels issued after
cuD3D10MapResources() begin.

If any of ppResources have not been registered for use with CUDA or if ppResources
contains any duplicate entries, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is
returned. If any of ppResources are presently mapped for access by CUDA, then
CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED is returned.

##### CUresult cuD3D10RegisterResource (ID3D10Resource *pResource, unsigned int Flags)

Register a Direct3D resource for access by CUDA.

###### Parameters

**pResource**

  - Resource to register
**Flags**

  - Parameters for resource registration

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY,
CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Registers the Direct3D resource pResource for access by CUDA.

If this call is successful, then the application will be able to map and unmap this resource until it
is unregistered through cuD3D10UnregisterResource(). Also on success, this call will increase the
internal reference count on pResource. This reference count will be decremented when this resource
is unregistered through cuD3D10UnregisterResource().

This call is potentially high-overhead and should not be called every frame in interactive applications.

The type of pResource must be one of the following.

ID3D10Buffer: Cannot be used with set to CU_D3D10_REGISTER_FLAGS_ARRAY.

###### ‣ Flags

ID3D10Texture1D: No restrictions.

###### **‣**

ID3D10Texture2D: No restrictions.

###### **‣**

ID3D10Texture3D: No restrictions.

###### **‣**

The Flags argument specifies the mechanism through which CUDA will access the Direct3D
resource. The following values are allowed.

CU_D3D10_REGISTER_FLAGS_NONE: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource

###### **‣**

through a CUdeviceptr. The pointer, size, and (for textures), pitch for each subresource
of this allocation may be queried through cuD3D10ResourceGetMappedPointer(),
cuD3D10ResourceGetMappedSize(), and cuD3D10ResourceGetMappedPitch() respectively. This
option is valid for all resource types.
CU_D3D10_REGISTER_FLAGS_ARRAY: Specifies that CUDA will access this resource

###### **‣**

through a CUarray queried on a sub-resource basis through cuD3D10ResourceGetMappedArray().


CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  639


Modules


This option is only valid for resources of type ID3D10Texture1D, ID3D10Texture2D, and
ID3D10Texture3D.

Not all Direct3D resources of the above types may be used for interoperability with CUDA. The
following are some limitations.

The primary rendertarget may not be registered with CUDA.

###### **‣**

Resources allocated as shared may not be registered with CUDA.

###### **‣**

Textures which are not of a format which is 1, 2, or 4 channels of 8, 16, or 32-bit integer or

###### **‣**

floating-point data cannot be shared.
Surfaces of depth or stencil formats cannot be shared.

###### **‣**

If Direct3D interoperability is not initialized on this context then
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is returned. If pResource is of incorrect type or is already
registered, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If pResource cannot be
registered, then CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN is returned.


Note:


Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Modules

###### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 3.0.

Returns in *pPitch and *pPitchSlice the pitch and Z-slice pitch of the subresource of the
mapped Direct3D resource pResource, which corresponds to SubResource. The values set in
pPitch and pPitchSlice may change every time that pResource is mapped.

The pitch and Z-slice pitch values may be used to compute the location of a sample on a surface as
follows.

For a 2D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position x, y from the base pointer of the surface is:

y * pitch + (bytes per pixel) * x

For a 3D surface, the byte offset of the sample at position x, y, z from the base pointer of the surface is:

z* slicePitch + y * pitch + (bytes per pixel) * x

Both parameters pPitch and pPitchSlice are optional and may be set to NULL.

If pResource is not of type IDirect3DBaseTexture10 or one of its sub-types or if pResource has
not been registered for use with CUDA, then CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If

Changes to flags will take effect the next time pResource is mapped. The Flags argument may be
any of the following.

CU_D3D10_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_NONE: Specifies no hints about how this resource

###### **‣**

will be used. It is therefore assumed that this resource will be read from and written to by CUDA
kernels. This is the default value.
CU_D3D10_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_READONLY: Specifies that CUDA kernels which

###### **‣**

access this resource will not write to this resource.
CU_D3D10_MAPRESOURCE_FLAGS_WRITEDISCARD: Specifies that CUDA kernels which

###### **‣**

access this resource will not read from this resource and will write over the entire contents of the
resource, so none of the data previously stored in the resource will be preserved.

If pResource has not been registered for use with CUDA, then
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE is returned. If pResource is presently mapped for access by
CUDA then CUDA_ERROR_ALREADY_MAPPED is returned.
