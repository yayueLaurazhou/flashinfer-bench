# CUresult cuTexObjectCreate (CUtexObject *pTexObject, const CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC *pResDesc, const CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC *pTexDesc, const CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC *pResViewDesc)

Creates a texture object.

###### Parameters

**pTexObject**

  - Texture object to create
**pResDesc**

  - Resource descriptor
**pTexDesc**

  - Texture descriptor
**pResViewDesc**

  - Resource view descriptor

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED,
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

###### Description

Creates a texture object and returns it in pTexObject. pResDesc describes the data to texture from.
pTexDesc describes how the data should be sampled. pResViewDesc is an optional argument that
specifies an alternate format for the data described by pResDesc, and also describes the subresource
region to restrict access to when texturing. pResViewDesc can only be specified if the type of
resource is a CUDA array or a CUDA mipmapped array not in a block compressed format.

Texture objects are only supported on devices of compute capability 3.0 or higher. Additionally, a
texture object is an opaque value, and, as such, should only be accessed through CUDA API calls.

The CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC structure is defined as:

Modules


CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::resType specifies the type of resource to texture from.

###### **‣**

CUresourceType is defined as:


If CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::resType is set to CU_RESOURCE_TYPE_ARRAY,
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::array::hArray must be set to a valid CUDA array handle.


If CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::resType is set to CU_RESOURCE_TYPE_MIPMAPPED_ARRAY,
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::mipmap::hMipmappedArray must be set to a valid CUDA
mipmapped array handle.


If CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::resType is set to CU_RESOURCE_TYPE_LINEAR,
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::linear::devPtr must be set to a valid device
pointer, that is aligned to CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_TEXTURE_ALIGNMENT.
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::linear::format and
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::linear::numChannels describe the format of each component and
the number of components per array element. CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::linear::sizeInBytes
specifies the size of the array in bytes. The total number of elements in the linear address range cannot
exceed CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MAXIMUM_TEXTURE1D_LINEAR_WIDTH. The number of
elements is computed as (sizeInBytes / (sizeof(format) * numChannels)).


If CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::resType is set to CU_RESOURCE_TYPE_PITCH2D,
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::devPtr must be set to a valid device
pointer, that is aligned to CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_TEXTURE_ALIGNMENT.
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::format and
CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::numChannels describe the format of each component
and the number of components per array element. CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::width
and CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::height specify
the width and height of the array in elements, and cannot exceed
CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MAXIMUM_TEXTURE2D_LINEAR_WIDTH and
CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MAXIMUM_TEXTURE2D_LINEAR_HEIGHT respectively.


CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  528


Modules


CUDA_RESOURCE_DESC::res::pitch2D::pitchInBytes specifies the pitch between two rows in
bytes and has to be aligned to CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_TEXTURE_PITCH_ALIGNMENT. Pitch
cannot exceed CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MAXIMUM_TEXTURE2D_LINEAR_PITCH.

flags must be set to zero.

The CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC struct is defined as


CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::addressMode specifies the addressing mode for each dimension of the

###### **‣**

texture data. CUaddress_mode is defined as:

Also, if the flag, CU_TRSF_NORMALIZED_COORDINATES is not set, the only supported
address mode is CU_TR_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP.

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::filterMode specifies the filtering mode to be used when fetching from

###### **‣**

the texture. CUfilter_mode is defined as:


CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::flags can be any combination of the following:

###### **‣**

CU_TRSF_READ_AS_INTEGER, which suppresses the default behavior of having the

###### **‣**

texture promote integer data to floating point data in the range [0, 1]. Note that texture with 32bit integer format would not be promoted, regardless of whether or not this flag is specified.
CU_TRSF_NORMALIZED_COORDINATES, which suppresses the default behavior of

###### **‣**

having the texture coordinates range from [0, Dim) where Dim is the width or height of the
CUDA array. Instead, the texture coordinates [0, 1.0) reference the entire breadth of the array
dimension; Note that for CUDA mipmapped arrays, this flag has to be set.
CU_TRSF_DISABLE_TRILINEAR_OPTIMIZATION, which disables any trilinear filtering

###### **‣**

optimizations. Trilinear optimizations improve texture filtering performance by allowing
bilinear filtering on textures in scenarios where it can closely approximate the expected results.
CU_TRSF_SEAMLESS_CUBEMAP, which enables seamless cube map filtering.

###### **‣**

This flag can only be specified if the underlying resource is a CUDA array or a CUDA

Modules


mipmapped array that was created with the flag CUDA_ARRAY3D_CUBEMAP.
When seamless cube map filtering is enabled, texture address modes specified
by CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::addressMode are ignored. Instead, if the
CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::filterMode is set to CU_TR_FILTER_MODE_POINT the
address mode CU_TR_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP will be applied for all dimensions. If the
CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::filterMode is set to CU_TR_FILTER_MODE_LINEAR seamless
cube map filtering will be performed when sampling along the cube face borders.

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::maxAnisotropy specifies the maximum anisotropy ratio to be used

###### **‣**

when doing anisotropic filtering. This value will be clamped to the range [1,16].

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::mipmapFilterMode specifies the filter mode when the calculated

###### **‣**

mipmap level lies between two defined mipmap levels.

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::mipmapLevelBias specifies the offset to be applied to the calculated

###### **‣**

mipmap level.

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::minMipmapLevelClamp specifies the lower end of the mipmap level

###### **‣**

range to clamp access to.

CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::maxMipmapLevelClamp specifies the upper end of the mipmap level

###### **‣**

range to clamp access to.

The CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC struct is defined as


CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::format specifies how the data contained in the CUDA

###### **‣**

array or CUDA mipmapped array should be interpreted. Note that this can incur a change
in size of the texture data. If the resource view format is a block compressed format, then
the underlying CUDA array or CUDA mipmapped array has to have a base of format
CU_AD_FORMAT_UNSIGNED_INT32. with 2 or 4 channels, depending on the block
compressed format. For ex., BC1 and BC4 require the underlying CUDA array to have a format
of CU_AD_FORMAT_UNSIGNED_INT32 with 2 channels. The other BC formats require the
underlying resource to have the same base format but with 4 channels.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::width specifies the new width of the texture data. If the

###### **‣**

resource view format is a block compressed format, this value has to be 4 times the original width
of the resource. For non block compressed formats, this value has to be equal to that of the original
resource.

Modules


CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::height specifies the new height of the texture data. If the

###### **‣**

resource view format is a block compressed format, this value has to be 4 times the original height
of the resource. For non block compressed formats, this value has to be equal to that of the original
resource.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::depth specifies the new depth of the texture data. This value

###### **‣**

has to be equal to that of the original resource.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::firstMipmapLevel specifies the most detailed

###### **‣**

mipmap level. This will be the new mipmap level zero. For non-mipmapped resources,
this value has to be zero.CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::minMipmapLevelClamp and
CUDA_TEXTURE_DESC::maxMipmapLevelClamp will be relative to this value. For ex., if the
firstMipmapLevel is set to 2, and a minMipmapLevelClamp of 1.2 is specified, then the actual
minimum mipmap level clamp will be 3.2.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::lastMipmapLevel specifies the least detailed mipmap level.

###### **‣**

For non-mipmapped resources, this value has to be zero.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::firstLayer specifies the first layer index for layered textures.

###### **‣**

This will be the new layer zero. For non-layered resources, this value has to be zero.

CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC::lastLayer specifies the last layer index for layered textures.

###### **‣**

For non-layered resources, this value has to be zero.
