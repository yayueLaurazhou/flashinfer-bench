# enum CUctx_flags

Context creation flags

###### Values

**CU_CTX_SCHED_AUTO = 0x00**
Automatic scheduling
**CU_CTX_SCHED_SPIN = 0x01**
Set spin as default scheduling
**CU_CTX_SCHED_YIELD = 0x02**
Set yield as default scheduling
**CU_CTX_SCHED_BLOCKING_SYNC = 0x04**
Set blocking synchronization as default scheduling
**CU_CTX_BLOCKING_SYNC = 0x04**
Set blocking synchronization as default scheduling Deprecated This flag was deprecated as of
CUDA 4.0 and was replaced with CU_CTX_SCHED_BLOCKING_SYNC.
**CU_CTX_SCHED_MASK = 0x07**
**CU_CTX_MAP_HOST = 0x08**

Deprecated This flag was deprecated as of CUDA 11.0 and it no longer has any effect. All contexts
