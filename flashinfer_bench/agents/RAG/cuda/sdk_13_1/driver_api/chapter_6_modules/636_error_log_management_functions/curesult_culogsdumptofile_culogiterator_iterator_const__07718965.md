# CUresult cuLogsDumpToFile (CUlogIterator *iterator, const char *pathToFile, unsigned int flags)

Dump accumulated driver logs into a file.

###### Parameters

**iterator**

  - Optional auto-advancing iterator specifying the starting log to read. NULL value dumps all logs.
**pathToFile**

  - Path to output file for dumping logs
**flags**

  - Reserved for future use, must be 0

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

###### Description

Logs generated by the driver are stored in an internal buffer and can be copied out using this API. This
API dumps all driver logs starting from iterator into pathToFile provided.


Note:

**‣** iterator is auto-advancing. Dumping logs will update the value of iterator to receive the
next generated log.

**‣** The driver reserves limited memory for storing logs. The oldest logs may be overwritten and
become unrecoverable. An indication will appear in the destination outupt if the logs have been
truncated. Call dump after each failed API to mitigate this risk.
