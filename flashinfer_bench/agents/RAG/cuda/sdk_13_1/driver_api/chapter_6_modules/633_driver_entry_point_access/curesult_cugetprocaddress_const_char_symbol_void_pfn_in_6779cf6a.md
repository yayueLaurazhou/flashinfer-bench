# CUresult cuGetProcAddress (const char *symbol, void **pfn, int cudaVersion, cuuint64_t flags, CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult *symbolStatus)

Returns the requested driver API function pointer.

###### Parameters

**symbol**

  - The base name of the driver API function to look for. As an example, for the driver API
cuMemAlloc_v2, symbol would be cuMemAlloc and cudaVersion would be the ABI
compatible CUDA version for the _v2 variant.
**pfn**

  - Location to return the function pointer to the requested driver function
**cudaVersion**

  - The CUDA version to look for the requested driver symbol
**flags**

  - Flags to specify search options.
**symbolStatus**

  - Optional location to store the status of the search for symbol based on cudaVersion. See
CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult for possible values.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED

###### Description

Returns in **pfn the address of the CUDA driver function for the requested CUDA version and flags.

The CUDA version is specified as (1000 * major + 10 * minor), so CUDA 11.2 should be specified
as 11020. For a requested driver symbol, if the specified CUDA version is greater than or equal to the
CUDA version in which the driver symbol was introduced, this API will return the function pointer to
the corresponding versioned function. If the specified CUDA version is greater than the driver version,
the API will return CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE.

The pointer returned by the API should be cast to a function pointer matching the requested driver
function's definition in the API header file. The function pointer typedef can be picked up from the
corresponding typedefs header file. For example, cudaTypedefs.h consists of function pointer typedefs
for driver APIs defined in cuda.h.

The API will return CUDA_SUCCESS and set the returned pfn to NULL if the requested driver
function is not supported on the platform, no ABI compatible driver function exists for the specified
cudaVersion or if the driver symbol is invalid.

It will also set the optional symbolStatus to one of the values in CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult
with the following meanings:


CUDA Driver API TRM-06703-001 _vRelease Version  |  563


Modules


CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SUCCESS  - The requested symbol was succesfully found based on

###### **‣**

input arguments and pfn is valid
CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND  - The requested symbol was not found

###### **‣**

CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT  - The requested symbol was found

###### **‣**

but is not supported by cudaVersion specified

The requested flags can be:

CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT: This is the default mode. This is

###### **‣**

equivalent to CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM
if the code is compiled with --default-stream per-thread compilation flag or
the macro CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM is defined;
CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_LEGACY_STREAM otherwise.
CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_LEGACY_STREAM: This will enable the search for all driver

###### **‣**

symbols that match the requested driver symbol name except the corresponding per-thread
versions.
CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM: This will enable the

###### **‣**

search for all driver symbols that match the requested driver symbol name including the per-thread
versions. If a per-thread version is not found, the API will return the legacy version of the driver
function.
