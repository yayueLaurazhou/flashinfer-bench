Warning

This document has been replaced by a new [CUDA Programming Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide). The information in this document should be considered legacy, and this document is no longer being updated as of CUDA 13.0. Please refer to the [CUDA Programming Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide) for up-to-date information on CUDA.

The general specifications and features of a compute device depend on its compute capability (see [Compute Capability](#compute-capability)).

[Table 26](#features-and-technical-specifications-feature-support-per-compute-capability) and
[Table 27](#features-and-technical-specifications-technical-specifications-per-compute-capability) show the features and technical specifications associated with each compute capability that is currently supported.

Section [Floating-Point Standard](#floating-point-standard) reviews compliance with the IEEE floating-point standard.

Sections [Compute Capability 5.x](#compute-capability-5-x), [Compute Capability 6.x](#compute-capability-6-x), [Compute Capability 7.x](#compute-capability-7-x), [Compute Capability 8.x](#compute-capability-8-x), [Compute Capability 9.0](#compute-capability-9-0), [Compute Capability 10.0](#compute-capability-10-0), and [Compute Capability 12.0](#compute-capability-12-0) give more details on the architecture of devices with these respective compute capabilities.
