# 13.2.2.1.1. Global Memory

##### 13.2.2.1.1. Global Memory[](#global-memory "Permalink to this headline")

Parent and child grids have coherent access to global memory, with weak consistency guarantees between child and parent. There is only one point of time in the execution of a child grid when its view of memory is fully consistent with the parent thread: at the point when the child grid is invoked by the parent.

All global memory operations in the parent thread prior to the child grid’s invocation are visible to the child grid. With the removal of `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`, it is no longer possible to access the modifications made by the threads in the child grid from the parent grid. The only way to access the modifications made by the threads in the child grid before the parent grid exits is via a kernel launched into the `cudaStreamTailLaunch` stream.

In the following example, the child grid executing `child_launch` is only guaranteed to see the modifications to `data` made before the child grid was launched. Since thread 0 of the parent is performing the launch, the child will be consistent with the memory seen by thread 0 of the parent. Due to the first `__syncthreads()` call, the child will see `data[0]=0`, `data[1]=1`, …, `data[255]=255` (without the `__syncthreads()` call, only `data[0]=0` would be guaranteed to be seen by the child). The child grid is only guaranteed to return at an implicit synchronization. This means that the modifications made by the threads in the child grid are never guaranteed to become available to the parent grid. To access modifications made by `child_launch`, a `tail_launch` kernel is launched into the `cudaStreamTailLaunch` stream.

```
__global__ void tail_launch(int *data) {
   data[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x]+1;
}

__global__ void child_launch(int *data) {
   data[threadIdx.x] = data[threadIdx.x]+1;
}

__global__ void parent_launch(int *data) {
   data[threadIdx.x] = threadIdx.x;

   __syncthreads();

   if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
       child_launch<<< 1, 256 >>>(data);
       tail_launch<<< 1, 256, 0, cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>(data);
   }
}

void host_launch(int *data) {
    parent_launch<<< 1, 256 >>>(data);
}
```
