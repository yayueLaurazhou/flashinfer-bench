# 13.3.1.2.3. The Tail Launch Stream

##### 13.3.1.2.3. The Tail Launch Stream[](#the-tail-launch-stream "Permalink to this headline")

The tail launch named stream (`cudaStreamTailLaunch`) allows a grid to schedule a new grid for launch after its completion. It should be possible to to use a tail launch to achieve the same functionality as a `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in most cases.

Each grid has its own tail launch stream. All non-tail launch work launched by a grid is implicitly synchronized before the tail stream is kicked off. I.e. A parent grid’s tail launch does not launch until the parent grid and all work launched by the parent grid to ordinary streams or per-thread or fire-and-forget streams have completed. If two grids are launched to the same grid’s tail launch stream, the later grid does not launch until the earlier grid and all its descendent work has completed.

```
// In this example, C2 will only launch after C1 completes.
__global__ void P( ... ) {
   C1<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );
   C2<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );
}
```

Grids launched into the tail launch stream will not launch until the completion of all work by the parent grid, including all other grids (and their descendants) launched by the parent in all non-tail launched streams, including work executed or launched after the tail launch.

```
// In this example, C will only launch after all X, F and P complete.
__global__ void P( ... ) {
   C<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );
   X<<< ... , cudaStreamPerThread >>>( ... );
   F<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... )
}
```

The next grid in the parent grid’s stream will not be launched before a parent grid’s tail launch work has completed. In other words, the tail launch stream behaves as if it were inserted between its parent grid and the next grid in its parent grid’s stream.

```
// In this example, P2 will only launch after C completes.
__global__ void P1( ... ) {
   C<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );
}

__global__ void P2( ... ) {
}

int main ( ... ) {
   ...
   P1<<< ... >>>( ... );
   P2<<< ... >>>( ... );
   ...
}
```

Each grid only gets one tail launch stream. To tail launch concurrent grids, it can be done like the example below.

```
// In this example,  C1 and C2 will launch concurrently after P's completion
__global__ void T( ... ) {
   C1<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );
   C2<<< ... , cudaStreamFireAndForget >>>( ... );
}

__global__ void P( ... ) {
   ...
   T<<< ... , cudaStreamTailLaunch >>>( ... );
}
```

The tail launch stream cannot be used to record or wait on events. Attempting to do so results in `cudaErrorInvalidValue`. The tail launch stream is not supported when compiled with `CUDA_FORCE_CDP1_IF_SUPPORTED` defined. Tail launch stream usage requires compilation to be in 64-bit mode.
