# 13.6.2.3.1. Including Device Runtime API in CUDA Code (CDP1)

##### 13.6.2.3.1. Including Device Runtime API in CUDA Code (CDP1)[](#including-device-runtime-api-in-cuda-code-cdp1 "Permalink to this headline")

See [Including Device Runtime API in CUDA Code](#including-device-runtime-api-in-cuda-code-cdp2), above, for CDP2 version of document.

Similar to the host-side runtime API, prototypes for the CUDA device runtime API are included automatically during program compilation. There is no need to include `cuda_device_runtime_api.h` explicitly.
