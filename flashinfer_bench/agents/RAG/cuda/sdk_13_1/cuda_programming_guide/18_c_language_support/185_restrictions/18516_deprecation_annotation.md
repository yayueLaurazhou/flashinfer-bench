# 18.5.16. Deprecation Annotation

### 18.5.16. Deprecation Annotation[](#deprecation-annotation "Permalink to this headline")

nvcc supports the use of `deprecated` attribute when using `gcc`, `clang`, `xlC`, `icc` or `pgcc` host compilers, and the use of `deprecated` declspec when using the `cl.exe` host compiler. It also supports the `[[deprecated]]` standard attribute when the C++14 dialect has been enabled. The CUDA frontend compiler will generate a deprecation diagnostic for a reference to a deprecated entity from within the body of a `__device__`, `__global__` or `__host__ __device__` function when `__CUDA_ARCH__` is defined (i.e., during device compilation phase). Other references to deprecated entities will be handled by the host compiler, e.g., a reference from within a `__host__` function.

The CUDA frontend compiler does not support the `#pragma gcc diagnostic` or `#pragma warning` mechanisms supported by various host compilers. Therefore, deprecation diagnostics generated by the CUDA frontend compiler are not affected by these pragmas, but diagnostics generated by the host compiler will be affected. To suppress the warning for device-code, user can use NVIDIA specific pragma [#pragma nv\_diag\_suppress](#nv-diagnostic-pragmas). The `nvcc` flag `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` can be used to suppress all deprecation warnings, and the flag `-Werror=deprecated-declarations` can be used to turn deprecation warnings into errors.
