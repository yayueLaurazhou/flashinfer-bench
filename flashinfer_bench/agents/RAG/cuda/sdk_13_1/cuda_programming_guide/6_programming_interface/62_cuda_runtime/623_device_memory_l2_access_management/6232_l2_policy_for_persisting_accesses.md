# 6.2.3.2. L2 Policy for Persisting Accesses

#### 6.2.3.2. L2 Policy for Persisting Accesses[](#l2-policy-for-persisting-accesses "Permalink to this headline")

An access policy window specifies a contiguous region of global memory and a persistence property in the L2 cache for accesses within that region.

The code example below shows how to set an L2 persisting access window using a CUDA Stream.

**CUDA Stream Example**

```
cudaStreamAttrValue stream_attribute;                                         // Stream level attributes data structure
stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.base_ptr  = reinterpret_cast<void*>(ptr); // Global Memory data pointer
stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.num_bytes = num_bytes;                    // Number of bytes for persistence access.
                                                                              // (Must be less than cudaDeviceProp::accessPolicyMaxWindowSize)
stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitRatio  = 0.6;                          // Hint for cache hit ratio
stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitProp   = cudaAccessPropertyPersisting; // Type of access property on cache hit
stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.missProp  = cudaAccessPropertyStreaming;  // Type of access property on cache miss.

//Set the attributes to a CUDA stream of type cudaStream_t
cudaStreamSetAttribute(stream, cudaStreamAttributeAccessPolicyWindow, &stream_attribute);
```

When a kernel subsequently executes in CUDA `stream`, memory accesses within the global memory extent `[ptr..ptr+num_bytes)` are more likely to persist in the L2 cache than accesses to other global memory locations.

L2 persistence can also be set for a CUDA Graph Kernel Node as shown in the example below:

**CUDA GraphKernelNode Example**

```
cudaKernelNodeAttrValue node_attribute;                                     // Kernel level attributes data structure
node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.base_ptr  = reinterpret_cast<void*>(ptr); // Global Memory data pointer
node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.num_bytes = num_bytes;                    // Number of bytes for persistence access.
                                                                            // (Must be less than cudaDeviceProp::accessPolicyMaxWindowSize)
node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitRatio  = 0.6;                          // Hint for cache hit ratio
node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitProp   = cudaAccessPropertyPersisting; // Type of access property on cache hit
node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.missProp  = cudaAccessPropertyStreaming;  // Type of access property on cache miss.

//Set the attributes to a CUDA Graph Kernel node of type cudaGraphNode_t
cudaGraphKernelNodeSetAttribute(node, cudaKernelNodeAttributeAccessPolicyWindow, &node_attribute);
```

The `hitRatio` parameter can be used to specify the fraction of accesses that receive the `hitProp` property. In both of the examples above, 60% of the memory accesses in the global memory region `[ptr..ptr+num_bytes)` have the persisting property and 40% of the memory accesses have the streaming property. Which specific memory accesses are classified as persisting (the `hitProp`) is random with a probability of approximately `hitRatio`; the probability distribution depends upon the hardware architecture and the memory extent.

For example, if the L2 set-aside cache size is 16KB and the `num_bytes` in the `accessPolicyWindow` is 32KB:

* With a `hitRatio` of 0.5, the hardware will select, at random, 16KB of the 32KB window to be designated as persisting and cached in the set-aside L2 cache area.
* With a `hitRatio` of 1.0, the hardware will attempt to cache the whole 32KB window in the set-aside L2 cache area. Since the set-aside area is smaller than the window, cache lines will be evicted to keep the most recently used 16KB of the 32KB data in the set-aside portion of the L2 cache.

The `hitRatio` can therefore be used to avoid thrashing of cache lines and overall reduce the amount of data moved into and out of the L2 cache.

A `hitRatio` value below 1.0 can be used to manually control the amount of data different `accessPolicyWindow`s from concurrent CUDA streams can cache in L2. For example, let the L2 set-aside cache size be 16KB; two concurrent kernels in two different CUDA streams, each with a 16KB `accessPolicyWindow`, and both with `hitRatio` value 1.0, might evict each others’ cache lines when competing for the shared L2 resource. However, if both `accessPolicyWindows` have a hitRatio value of 0.5, they will be less likely to evict their own or each others’ persisting cache lines.
