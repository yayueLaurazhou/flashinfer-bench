# 6.2.8.7.3.2. Prohibited and Unhandled Operations

###### 6.2.8.7.3.2. Prohibited and Unhandled Operations[](#prohibited-and-unhandled-operations "Permalink to this headline")

It is invalid to synchronize or query the execution status of a stream which is being captured or a captured event, because they do not represent items scheduled for execution. It is also invalid to query the execution status of or synchronize a broader handle which encompasses an active stream capture, such as a device or context handle when any associated stream is in capture mode.

When any stream in the same context is being captured, and it was not created with `cudaStreamNonBlocking`, any attempted use of the legacy stream is invalid. This is because the legacy stream handle at all times encompasses these other streams; enqueueing to the legacy stream would create a dependency on the streams being captured, and querying it or synchronizing it would query or synchronize the streams being captured.

It is therefore also invalid to call synchronous APIs in this case. Synchronous APIs, such as `cudaMemcpy()`, enqueue work to the legacy stream and synchronize it before returning.

Note

As a general rule, when a dependency relation would connect something that is captured with something that was not captured and instead enqueued for execution, CUDA prefers to return an error rather than ignore the dependency. An exception is made for placing a stream into or out of capture mode; this severs a dependency relation between items added to the stream immediately before and after the mode transition.

It is invalid to merge two separate capture graphs by waiting on a captured event from a stream which is being captured and is associated with a different capture graph than the event. It is invalid to wait on a non-captured event from a stream which is being captured without specifying the cudaEventWaitExternal flag.

A small number of APIs that enqueue asynchronous operations into streams are not currently supported in graphs and will return an error if called with a stream which is being captured, such as `cudaStreamAttachMemAsync()`.
