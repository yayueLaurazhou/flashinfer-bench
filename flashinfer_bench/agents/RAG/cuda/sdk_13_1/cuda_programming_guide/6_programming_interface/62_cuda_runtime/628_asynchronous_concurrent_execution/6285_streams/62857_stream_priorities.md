# 6.2.8.5.7. Stream Priorities

##### 6.2.8.5.7. Stream Priorities[](#stream-priorities "Permalink to this headline")

The relative priorities of streams can be specified at creation using `cudaStreamCreateWithPriority()`. The range of allowable priorities, ordered as [ greatest priority, least priority ] can be obtained using the `cudaDeviceGetStreamPriorityRange()` function. At runtime, the GPU scheduler utilizes stream priorities to determine task execution order, but these priorities serve as hints rather than guarantees. When selecting work to launch, pending tasks in higher-priority streams take precedence over those in lower-priority streams. Higher-priority tasks do not preempt already running lower-priority tasks. The GPU does not reassess work queues during task execution, and increasing a stream’s priority will not interrupt ongoing work. Stream priorities influence task execution without enforcing strict ordering, so users can leverage stream priorities to influence task execution without relying on strict ordering guarantees.

The following code sample obtains the allowable range of priorities for the current device, and creates streams with the highest and lowest available priorities.

```
// get the range of stream priorities for this device
int leastPriority, greatestPriority;
cudaDeviceGetStreamPriorityRange(&leastPriority, &greatestPriority);
// create streams with highest and lowest available priorities
cudaStream_t st_high, st_low;
cudaStreamCreateWithPriority(&st_high, cudaStreamNonBlocking, greatestPriority));
cudaStreamCreateWithPriority(&st_low, cudaStreamNonBlocking, leastPriority);
```
