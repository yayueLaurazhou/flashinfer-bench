###### 6.2.8.7.7.2.1.4. Sibling Launch[](#sibling-launch "Permalink to this headline")

Sibling launch is a variation of fire-and-forget launch in which the graph is launched not as a child of the launching graph’s execution environment, but rather as a child of the launching graph’s parent environment. Sibling launch is equivalent to a fire-and-forget launch from the launching graph’s parent environment.

The above diagram can be generated by the sample code below:

```
__global__ void launchSiblingGraph(cudaGraphExec_t graph) {
    cudaGraphLaunch(graph, cudaStreamGraphFireAndForgetAsSibling);
}

void graphSetup() {
    cudaGraphExec_t gExec1, gExec2;
    cudaGraph_t g1, g2;

    // Create, instantiate, and upload the device graph.
    create_graph(&g2);
    cudaGraphInstantiate(&gExec2, g2, cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch);
    cudaGraphUpload(gExec2, stream);

    // Create and instantiate the launching graph.
    cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);
    launchSiblingGraph<<<1, 1, 0, stream>>>(gExec2);
    cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &g1);
    cudaGraphInstantiate(&gExec1, g1);

    // Launch the host graph, which will in turn launch the device graph.
    cudaGraphLaunch(gExec1, stream);
}
```

Since sibling launches are not launched into the launching graph’s execution environment, they will not gate tail launches enqueued by the launching graph.
