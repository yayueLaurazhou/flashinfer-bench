# 6.2.8.5. Streams

#### 6.2.8.5. Streams[](#streams "Permalink to this headline")

Applications manage the concurrent operations described above through *streams*. A stream is a sequence of commands (possibly issued by different host threads) that execute in order. Different streams, on the other hand, may execute their commands out of order with respect to one another or concurrently; this behavior is not guaranteed and should therefore not be relied upon for correctness (for example, inter-kernel communication is undefined). The commands issued on a stream may execute when all the dependencies of the command are met. The dependencies could be previously launched commands on same stream or dependencies from other streams. The successful completion of synchronize call guarantees that all the commands launched are completed.
