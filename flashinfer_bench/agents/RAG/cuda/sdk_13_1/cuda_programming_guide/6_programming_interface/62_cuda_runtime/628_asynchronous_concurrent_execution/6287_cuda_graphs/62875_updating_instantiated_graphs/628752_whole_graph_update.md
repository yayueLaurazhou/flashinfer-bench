# 6.2.8.7.5.2. Whole Graph Update

###### 6.2.8.7.5.2. Whole Graph Update[](#whole-graph-update "Permalink to this headline")

`cudaGraphExecUpdate()` allows an instantiated graph (the “original graph”) to be updated with the parameters from a topologically identical graph (the “updating” graph). The topology of the updating graph must be identical to the original graph used to instantiate the `cudaGraphExec_t`. In addition, the order in which the dependencies are specified must match. Finally, CUDA needs to consistently order the sink nodes (nodes with no dependencies). CUDA relies on the order of specific api calls to achieve consistent sink node ordering.

More explicitly, following the following rules will cause `cudaGraphExecUpdate()` to pair the nodes in the original graph and the updating graph deterministically:

1. For any capturing stream, the API calls operating on that stream must be made in the same order, including event wait and other api calls not directly corresponding to node creation.
2. The API calls which directly manipulate a given graph node’s incoming edges (including captured stream APIs, node add APIs, and edge addition / removal APIs) must be made in the same order. Moreover, when dependencies are specified in arrays to these APIs, the order in which the dependencies are specified inside those arrays must match.
3. Sink nodes must be consistently ordered. Sink nodes are nodes without dependent nodes / outgoing edges in the final graph at the time of the `cudaGraphExecUpdate()` invocation. The following operations affect sink node ordering (if present) and must (as a combined set) be made in the same order:

   * Node add APIs resulting in a sink node.
   * Edge removal resulting in a node becoming a sink node.
   * `cudaStreamUpdateCaptureDependencies()`, if it removes a sink node from a capturing stream’s dependency set.
   * `cudaStreamEndCapture()`.

The following example shows how the API could be used to update an instantiated graph:

```
cudaGraphExec_t graphExec = NULL;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cudaGraph_t graph;
    cudaGraphExecUpdateResult updateResult;
    cudaGraphNode_t errorNode;

    // In this example we use stream capture to create the graph.
    // You can also use the Graph API to produce a graph.
    cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);

    // Call a user-defined, stream based workload, for example
    do_cuda_work(stream);

    cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);

    // If we've already instantiated the graph, try to update it directly
    // and avoid the instantiation overhead
    if (graphExec != NULL) {
        // If the graph fails to update, errorNode will be set to the
        // node causing the failure and updateResult will be set to a
        // reason code.
        cudaGraphExecUpdate(graphExec, graph, &errorNode, &updateResult);
    }

    // Instantiate during the first iteration or whenever the update
    // fails for any reason
    if (graphExec == NULL || updateResult != cudaGraphExecUpdateSuccess) {

        // If a previous update failed, destroy the cudaGraphExec_t
        // before re-instantiating it
        if (graphExec != NULL) {
            cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec);
        }
        // Instantiate graphExec from graph. The error node and
        // error message parameters are unused here.
        cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, 0);
    }

    cudaGraphDestroy(graph);
    cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);
}
```

A typical workflow is to create the initial `cudaGraph_t` using either the stream capture or graph API. The `cudaGraph_t` is then instantiated and launched as normal. After the initial launch, a new `cudaGraph_t` is created using the same method as the initial graph and `cudaGraphExecUpdate()` is called. If the graph update is successful, indicated by the `updateResult` parameter in the above example, the updated `cudaGraphExec_t` is launched. If the update fails for any reason, the `cudaGraphExecDestroy()` and `cudaGraphInstantiate()` are called to destroy the original `cudaGraphExec_t` and instantiate a new one.

It is also possible to update the `cudaGraph_t` nodes directly (i.e., Using `cudaGraphKernelNodeSetParams()`) and subsequently update the `cudaGraphExec_t`, however it is more efficient to use the explicit node update APIs covered in the next section.

Conditional handle flags and default values are updated as part of the graph update.
