# 6.5. Mode Switches

## 6.5. Mode Switches[](#mode-switches "Permalink to this headline")

GPUs that have a display output dedicate some DRAM memory to the so-called *primary surface*, which is used to refresh the display device whose output is viewed by the user. When users initiate a *mode switch* of the display by changing the resolution or bit depth of the display (using NVIDIA control panel or the Display control panel on Windows), the amount of memory needed for the primary surface changes. For example, if the user changes the display resolution from 1280x1024x32-bit to 1600x1200x32-bit, the system must dedicate 7.68 MB to the primary surface rather than 5.24 MB. (Full-screen graphics applications running with anti-aliasing enabled may require much more display memory for the primary surface.) On Windows, other events that may initiate display mode switches include launching a full-screen DirectX application, hitting Alt+Tab to task switch away from a full-screen DirectX application, or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Del to lock the computer.

If a mode switch increases the amount of memory needed for the primary surface, the system may have to cannibalize memory allocations dedicated to CUDA applications. Therefore, a mode switch results in any call to the CUDA runtime to fail and return an invalid context error.
