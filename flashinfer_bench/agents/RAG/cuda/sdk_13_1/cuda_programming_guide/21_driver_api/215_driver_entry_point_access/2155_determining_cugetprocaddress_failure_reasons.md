# 21.5.5. Determining cuGetProcAddress Failure Reasons

### 21.5.5. Determining cuGetProcAddress Failure Reasons[](#determining-cugetprocaddress-failure-reasons "Permalink to this headline")

There are two types of errors with cuGetProcAddress. Those are (1) API/usage errors and (2) inability to find the driver API requested. The first error type will return error codes from the API via the CUresult return value. Things like passing NULL as the `pfn` variable or passing invalid `flags`.

The second error type encodes in the `CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult *symbolStatus` and can be used to help distinguish potential issues with the driver not being able to find the symbol requested. Take the following example:

```
// cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport was introduced in release CUDA 11.4
#include <cuda.h>
CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus;
cudaVersion = ...;
status = cuGetProcAddress("cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport", &pfn, cudaVersion, 0, &driverStatus);
if (CUDA_SUCCESS == status) {
    if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT == driverStatus) {
        printf("We can use the new feature when you upgrade cudaVersion to 11.4, but CUDA driver is good to go!\n");
        // Indicating cudaVersion was < 11.4 but run against a CUDA driver >= 11.4
    }
    else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND == driverStatus) {
        printf("Please update both CUDA driver and cudaVersion to at least 11.4 to use the new feature!\n");
        // Indicating driver is < 11.4 since string not found, doesn't matter what cudaVersion was
    }
    else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SUCCESS == driverStatus && pfn) {
        printf("You're using cudaVersion and CUDA driver >= 11.4, using new feature!\n");
        pfn();
    }
}
```

The first case with the return code `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT` indicates that the `symbol` was found when searching in the CUDA driver but it was added later than the `cudaVersion` supplied. In the example, specifying `cudaVersion` as anything 11030 or less and when running against a CUDA driver >= CUDA 11.4 would give this result of `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT`. This is because `cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport` was added in CUDA 11.4 (11040).

The second case with the return code `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` indicates that the `symbol` was not found when searching in the CUDA driver. This can be due to a few reasons such as unsupported CUDA function due to older driver as well as just having a typo. In the latter, similar to the last example if the user had put `symbol` as CUDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport - notice the capital CU to start the string - `cuGetProcAddress` would not be able to find the API because the string doesn’t match. In the former case an example might be the user developing an application against a CUDA driver supporting the new API, and deploying the application against an older CUDA driver. Using the last example, if the developer developed against CUDA 11.4 or later but was deployed against a CUDA 11.3 driver, during their development they may have had a succesful `cuGetProcAddress`, but when deploying an application running against a CUDA 11.3 driver the call would no longer work with the `CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` returned in `driverStatus`.
