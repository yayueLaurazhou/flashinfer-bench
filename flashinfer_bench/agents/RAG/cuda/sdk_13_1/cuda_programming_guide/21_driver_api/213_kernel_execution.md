# 21.3. Kernel Execution

## 21.3. Kernel Execution[](#kernel-execution "Permalink to this headline")

`cuLaunchKernel()` launches a kernel with a given execution configuration.

Parameters are passed either as an array of pointers (next to last parameter of `cuLaunchKernel()`) where the nth pointer corresponds to the nth parameter and points to a region of memory from which the parameter is copied, or as one of the extra options (last parameter of `cuLaunchKernel()`).

When parameters are passed as an extra option (the `CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER` option), they are passed as a pointer to a single buffer where parameters are assumed to be properly offset with respect to each other by matching the alignment requirement for each parameter type in device code.

Alignment requirements in device code for the built-in vector types are listed in [Table 7](#vector-types-alignment-requirements-in-device-code). For all other basic types, the alignment requirement in device code matches the alignment requirement in host code and can therefore be obtained using `__alignof()`. The only exception is when the host compiler aligns `double` and `long long` (and `long` on a 64-bit system) on a one-word boundary instead of a two-word boundary (for example, using `gcc`’s compilation flag `-mno-align-double`) since in device code these types are always aligned on a two-word boundary.

`CUdeviceptr` is an integer, but represents a pointer, so its alignment requirement is `__alignof(void*)`.

The following code sample uses a macro (`ALIGN_UP()`) to adjust the offset of each parameter to meet its alignment requirement and another macro (`ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER()`) to add each parameter to the parameter buffer passed to the `CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER` option.

```
#define ALIGN_UP(offset, alignment) \
      (offset) = ((offset) + (alignment) - 1) & ~((alignment) - 1)

char paramBuffer[1024];
size_t paramBufferSize = 0;

#define ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(value, alignment)                   \
    do {                                                        \
        paramBufferSize = ALIGN_UP(paramBufferSize, alignment); \
        memcpy(paramBuffer + paramBufferSize,                   \
               &(value), sizeof(value));                        \
        paramBufferSize += sizeof(value);                       \
    } while (0)

int i;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(i, __alignof(i));
float4 f4;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f4, 16); // float4's alignment is 16
char c;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(c, __alignof(c));
float f;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f, __alignof(f));
CUdeviceptr devPtr;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(devPtr, __alignof(devPtr));
float2 f2;
ADD_TO_PARAM_BUFFER(f2, 8); // float2's alignment is 8

void* extra[] = {
    CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER, paramBuffer,
    CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_SIZE,    &paramBufferSize,
    CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END
};
cuLaunchKernel(cuFunction,
               blockWidth, blockHeight, blockDepth,
               gridWidth, gridHeight, gridDepth,
               0, 0, 0, extra);
```

The alignment requirement of a structure is equal to the maximum of the alignment requirements of its fields. The alignment requirement of a structure that contains built-in vector types, `CUdeviceptr`, or non-aligned `double` and `long long`, might therefore differ between device code and host code. Such a structure might also be padded differently. The following structure, for example, is not padded at all in host code, but it is padded in device code with 12 bytes after field `f` since the alignment requirement for field `f4` is 16.

```
typedef struct {
    float  f;
    float4 f4;
} myStruct;
```
