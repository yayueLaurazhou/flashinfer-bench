# 16.3.4. cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch

### 16.3.4. cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch[](#cudagraphinstantiateflagautofreeonlaunch "Permalink to this headline")

Under normal circumstances, CUDA will prevent a graph from being relaunched if it has unfreed memory allocations because multiple allocations at the same address will leak memory. Instantiating a graph with the `cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch` flag allows the graph to be relaunched while it still has unfreed allocations. In this case, the launch automatically inserts an asynchronous free of the unfreed allocations.

Auto free on launch is useful for single-producer multiple-consumer algorithms. At each iteration, a producer graph creates several allocations, and, depending on runtime conditions, a varying set of consumers accesses those allocations. This type of variable execution sequence means that consumers cannot free the allocations because a subsequent consumer may require access. Auto free on launch means that the launch loop does not need to track the producer’s allocations - instead, that information remains isolated to the producer’s creation and destruction logic. In general, auto free on launch simplifies an algorithm which would otherwise need to free all the allocations owned by a graph before each relaunch.

Note

The `cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch` flag does not change the behavior of graph destruction. The application must explicitly free the unfreed memory in order to avoid memory leaks, even for graphs instantiated with the flag.
The following code shows the use of `cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch` to simplify a single-producer / multiple-consumer algorithm:

```
// Create producer graph which allocates memory and populates it with data
cudaStreamBeginCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);
cudaMallocAsync(&data1, blocks * threads, cudaStreamPerThread);
cudaMallocAsync(&data2, blocks * threads, cudaStreamPerThread);
produce<<<blocks, threads, 0, cudaStreamPerThread>>>(data1, data2);
...
cudaStreamEndCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, &graph);
cudaGraphInstantiateWithFlags(&producer,
                              graph,
                              cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch);
cudaGraphDestroy(graph);

// Create first consumer graph by capturing an asynchronous library call
cudaStreamBeginCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);
consumerFromLibrary(data1, cudaStreamPerThread);
cudaStreamEndCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, &graph);
cudaGraphInstantiateWithFlags(&consumer1, graph, 0); //regular instantiation
cudaGraphDestroy(graph);

// Create second consumer graph
cudaStreamBeginCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);
consume2<<<blocks, threads, 0, cudaStreamPerThread>>>(data2);
...
cudaStreamEndCapture(cudaStreamPerThread, &graph);
cudaGraphInstantiateWithFlags(&consumer2, graph, 0);
cudaGraphDestroy(graph);

// Launch in a loop
bool launchConsumer2 = false;
do {
    cudaGraphLaunch(producer, myStream);
    cudaGraphLaunch(consumer1, myStream);
    if (launchConsumer2) {
        cudaGraphLaunch(consumer2, myStream);
    }
} while (determineAction(&launchConsumer2));

cudaFreeAsync(data1, myStream);
cudaFreeAsync(data2, myStream);

cudaGraphExecDestroy(producer);
cudaGraphExecDestroy(consumer1);
cudaGraphExecDestroy(consumer2);
```
