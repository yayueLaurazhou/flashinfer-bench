# 10.1.3. __host__

### 10.1.3. \_\_host\_\_[](#host "Permalink to this headline")

The `__host__` execution space specifier declares a function that is:

* Executed on the host,
* Callable from the host only.

It is equivalent to declare a function with only the `__host__` execution space specifier or to declare it without any of the `__host__`, `__device__`, or `__global__` execution space specifier; in either case the function is compiled for the host only.

The `__global__` and `__host__` execution space specifiers cannot be used together.

The `__device__` and `__host__` execution space specifiers can be used together however, in which case the function is compiled for both the host and the device. The `__CUDA_ARCH__` macro introduced in [Application Compatibility](#application-compatibility) can be used to differentiate code paths between host and device:

```
__host__ __device__ func()
{
#if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 800
   // Device code path for compute capability 8.x
#elif __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700
   // Device code path for compute capability 7.x
#elif __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600
   // Device code path for compute capability 6.x
#elif __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 500
   // Device code path for compute capability 5.x
#elif !defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)
   // Host code path
#endif
}
```
