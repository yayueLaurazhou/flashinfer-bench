### 10.24.5. Restrictions[](#wmma-restrictions "Permalink to this headline")

The special format required by tensor cores may be different for each major and minor device architecture. This is further complicated by threads holding only a fragment (opaque architecture-specific ABI data structure) of the overall matrix, with the developer not allowed to make assumptions on how the individual parameters are mapped to the registers participating in the matrix multiply-accumulate.

Since fragments are architecture-specific, it is unsafe to pass them from function A to function B if the functions have been compiled for different link-compatible architectures and linked together into the same device executable. In this case, the size and layout of the fragment will be specific to one architecture and using WMMA APIs in the other will lead to incorrect results or potentially, corruption.

An example of two link-compatible architectures, where the layout of the fragment differs, is sm\_70 and sm\_75.

```
fragA.cu: void foo() { wmma::fragment<...> mat_a; bar(&mat_a); }
fragB.cu: void bar(wmma::fragment<...> *mat_a) { // operate on mat_a }
```

```
// sm_70 fragment layout
$> nvcc -dc -arch=compute_70 -code=sm_70 fragA.cu -o fragA.o
// sm_75 fragment layout
$> nvcc -dc -arch=compute_75 -code=sm_75 fragB.cu -o fragB.o
// Linking the two together
$> nvcc -dlink -arch=sm_75 fragA.o fragB.o -o frag.o
```

This undefined behavior might also be undetectable at compilation time and by tools at runtime, so extra care is needed to make sure the layout of the fragments is consistent. This linking hazard is most likely to appear when linking with a legacy library that is both built for a different link-compatible architecture and expecting to be passed a WMMA fragment.

Note that in the case of weak linkages (for example, a CUDA C++ inline function), the linker may choose any available function definition which may result in implicit passes between compilation units.

To avoid these sorts of problems, the matrix should always be stored out to memory for transit through external interfaces (e.g. `wmma::store_matrix_sync(dst, …);`) and then it can be safely passed to `bar()` as a pointer type [e.g. `float *dst`].

Note that since sm\_70 can run on sm\_75, the above example sm\_75 code can be changed to sm\_70 and correctly work on sm\_75. However, it is recommended to have sm\_75 native code in your application when linking with other sm\_75 separately compiled binaries.
