# 11.6.1.2. sync

#### 11.6.1.2. `sync`[](#sync "Permalink to this headline")

```
static void T::sync();

template <typename T>
void sync(T& group);
```

`sync` synchronizes the threads named in the group. Group type `T` can be any of the existing group types, as all of them support synchronization. Its available as a member function in every group type or as a free function taking a group as parameter.
If the group is a `grid_group` the kernel must have been launched using the appropriate cooperative launch APIs. Equivalent to `T.barrier_wait(T.barrier_arrive())`.
