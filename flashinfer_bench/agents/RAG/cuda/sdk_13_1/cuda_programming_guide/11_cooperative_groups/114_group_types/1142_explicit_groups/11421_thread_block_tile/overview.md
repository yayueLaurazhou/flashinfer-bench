# 11.4.2.1. Thread Block Tile

#### 11.4.2.1. Thread Block Tile[](#thread-block-tile "Permalink to this headline")

A templated version of a tiled group, where a template parameter is used to specify the size of the tile - with this known at compile time there is the potential for more optimal execution.

```
template <unsigned int Size, typename ParentT = void>
class thread_block_tile;
```

Constructed via:

```
template <unsigned int Size, typename ParentT>
_CG_QUALIFIER thread_block_tile<Size, ParentT> tiled_partition(const ParentT& g)
```

`Size` must be a power of 2 and less than or equal to 1024. Notes section describes extra steps needed to create tiles of size larger than 32 on hardware with Compute Capability 7.5 or lower.

`ParentT` is the parent-type from which this group was partitioned. It is automatically inferred, but a value of void will store this information in the group handle rather than in the type.

**Public Member Functions:**

`void sync() const`: Synchronize the threads named in the group

`unsigned long long num_threads() const`: Total number of threads in the group

`unsigned long long thread_rank() const`: Rank of the calling thread within [0, num\_threads)

`unsigned long long meta_group_size() const`: Returns the number of groups created when the parent group was partitioned.

`unsigned long long meta_group_rank() const`: Linear rank of the group within the set of tiles partitioned from a parent group (bounded by meta\_group\_size)

`T shfl(T var, unsigned int src_rank) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions), **Note: For sizes larger than 32 all threads in the group have to specify the same src\_rank, otherwise the behavior is undefined.**

`T shfl_up(T var, int delta) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

`T shfl_down(T var, int delta) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

`T shfl_xor(T var, int delta) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

`int any(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions)

`int all(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions)

`unsigned int ballot(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

`unsigned int match_any(T val) const`: Refer to [Warp Match Functions](#warp-match-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

`unsigned int match_all(T val, int &pred) const`: Refer to [Warp Match Functions](#warp-match-functions), available only for sizes lower or equal to 32.

Legacy member functions (aliases):

`unsigned long long size() const`: Total number of threads in the group (alias of `num_threads()`)

**Notes:**

* `thread_block_tile` templated data structure is being used here, the size of the group is passed to the `tiled_partition` call as a template parameter rather than an argument.
* `shfl, shfl_up, shfl_down, and shfl_xor` functions accept objects of any type when compiled with C++11 or later. This means it’s possible to shuffle non-integral types as long as they satisfy the below constraints:

  + Qualifies as trivially copyable i.e., `is_trivially_copyable<T>::value == true`
  + `sizeof(T) <= 32` for tile sizes lower or equal 32, `sizeof(T) <= 8` for larger tiles
* On hardware with Compute Capability 7.5 or lower tiles of size larger than 32 need small amount of memory reserved for them. This can be done using `cooperative_groups::block_tile_memory` struct template that has to reside in either shared or global memory.

  ```
  template <unsigned int MaxBlockSize = 1024>
  struct block_tile_memory;
  ```

  `MaxBlockSize` Specifies the maximal number of threads in the current thread block. This parameter can be used to minimize the shared memory usage of `block_tile_memory` in kernels launched only with smaller thread counts.

  This `block_tile_memory` needs be then passed into `cooperative_groups::this_thread_block`, allowing the resulting `thread_block` to be partitioned into tiles of sizes larger than 32. Overload of `this_thread_block` accepting `block_tile_memory` argument is a collective operation and has to be called with all threads in the `thread_block`.

  `block_tile_memory` can be used on hardware with Compute Capability 8.0 or higher in order to be able to write one source targeting multiple different Compute Capabilities. It should consume no memory when instantiated in shared memory in cases where its not required.

**Examples:**

```
/// The following code will create two sets of tiled groups, of size 32 and 4 respectively:
/// The latter has the provenance encoded in the type, while the first stores it in the handle
thread_block block = this_thread_block();
thread_block_tile<32> tile32 = tiled_partition<32>(block);
thread_block_tile<4, thread_block> tile4 = tiled_partition<4>(block);
```

```
/// The following code will create tiles of size 128 on all Compute Capabilities.
/// block_tile_memory can be omitted on Compute Capability 8.0 or higher.
__global__ void kernel(...) {
    // reserve shared memory for thread_block_tile usage,
    //   specify that block size will be at most 256 threads.
    __shared__ block_tile_memory<256> shared;
    thread_block thb = this_thread_block(shared);

    // Create tiles with 128 threads.
    auto tile = tiled_partition<128>(thb);

    // ...
}
```
