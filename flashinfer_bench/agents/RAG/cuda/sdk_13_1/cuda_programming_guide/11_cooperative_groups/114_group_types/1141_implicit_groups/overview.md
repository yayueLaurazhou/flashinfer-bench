# 11.4.1. Implicit Groups

### 11.4.1. Implicit Groups[](#implicit-groups "Permalink to this headline")

Implicit groups represent the launch configuration of the kernel. Regardless of how your kernel is written, it always has a set number of threads, blocks and block dimensions, a single grid and grid dimensions. In addition, if the multi-device cooperative launch API is used, it can have multiple grids (single grid per device). These groups provide a starting point for decomposition into finer grained groups which are typically HW accelerated and are more specialized for the problem the developer is solving.

Although you can create an implicit group anywhere in the code, it is dangerous to do so. Creating a handle for an implicit group is a collective operation—all threads in the group must participate. If the group was created in a conditional branch that not all threads reach, this can lead to deadlocks or data corruption. For this reason, it is recommended that you create a handle for the implicit group upfront (as early as possible, before any branching has occurred) and use that handle throughout the kernel. Group handles must be initialized at declaration time (there is no default constructor) for the same reason and copy-constructing them is discouraged.
