# 11.4.2.2. Coalesced Groups

#### 11.4.2.2. Coalesced Groups[](#coalesced-groups "Permalink to this headline")

In CUDA’s SIMT architecture, at the hardware level the multiprocessor executes threads in groups of 32 called warps. If there exists a data-dependent conditional branch in the application code such that threads within a warp diverge, then the warp serially executes each branch disabling threads not on that path. The threads that remain active on the path are referred to as coalesced. Cooperative Groups has functionality to discover, and create, a group containing all coalesced threads.

Constructing the group handle via `coalesced_threads()` is opportunistic. It returns the set of active threads at that point in time, and makes no guarantee about which threads are returned (as long as they are active) or that they will stay coalesced throughout execution (they will be brought back together for the execution of a collective but can diverge again afterwards).

`class coalesced_group;`

Constructed via:

```
coalesced_group active = coalesced_threads();
```

**Public Member Functions:**

`void sync() const`: Synchronize the threads named in the group

`unsigned long long num_threads() const`: Total number of threads in the group

`unsigned long long thread_rank() const`: Rank of the calling thread within [0, num\_threads)

`unsigned long long meta_group_size() const`: Returns the number of groups created when the parent group was partitioned. If this group was created by querying the set of active threads, for example `coalesced_threads()` the value of `meta_group_size()` will be 1.

`unsigned long long meta_group_rank() const`: Linear rank of the group within the set of tiles partitioned from a parent group (bounded by meta\_group\_size). If this group was created by querying the set of active threads, e.g. `coalesced_threads()` the value of `meta_group_rank()` will always be 0.

`T shfl(T var, unsigned int src_rank) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions)

`T shfl_up(T var, int delta) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions)

`T shfl_down(T var, int delta) const`: Refer to [Warp Shuffle Functions](#warp-shuffle-functions)

`int any(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions)

`int all(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions)

`unsigned int ballot(int predicate) const`: Refer to [Warp Vote Functions](index.html#warp-vote-functions)

`unsigned int match_any(T val) const`: Refer to [Warp Match Functions](#warp-match-functions)

`unsigned int match_all(T val, int &pred) const`: Refer to [Warp Match Functions](#warp-match-functions)

Legacy member functions (aliases):

`unsigned long long size() const`: Total number of threads in the group (alias of `num_threads()`)

**Notes:**

`shfl, shfl_up, and shfl_down` functions accept objects of any type when compiled with C++11 or later. This means it’s possible to shuffle non-integral types as long as they satisfy the below constraints:

* Qualifies as trivially copyable i.e. `is_trivially_copyable<T>::value == true`
* `sizeof(T) <= 32`

**Example:**

```
/// Consider a situation whereby there is a branch in the
/// code in which only the 2nd, 4th and 8th threads in each warp are
/// active. The coalesced_threads() call, placed in that branch, will create (for each
/// warp) a group, active, that has three threads (with
/// ranks 0-2 inclusive).
__global__ void kernel(int *globalInput) {
    // Lets say globalInput says that threads 2, 4, 8 should handle the data
    if (threadIdx.x == *globalInput) {
        coalesced_group active = coalesced_threads();
        // active contains 0-2 inclusive
        active.sync();
    }
}
```
