## 3.2. CUDA®: A General-Purpose Parallel Computing Platform and Programming Model[](#cuda-a-general-purpose-parallel-computing-platform-and-programming-model "Permalink to this headline")

In November 2006, NVIDIA® introduced CUDA®, a general purpose parallel computing platform and programming model that leverages the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs to solve many complex computational problems in a more efficient way than on a CPU.

CUDA comes with a software environment that allows developers to use C++ as a high-level programming language. As illustrated by [Figure 2](#cuda-general-purpose-parallel-computing-architecture-cuda-is-designed-to-support-various-languages-and-application-programming-interfaces), other languages, application programming interfaces, or directives-based approaches are supported, such as FORTRAN, DirectCompute, OpenACC.
