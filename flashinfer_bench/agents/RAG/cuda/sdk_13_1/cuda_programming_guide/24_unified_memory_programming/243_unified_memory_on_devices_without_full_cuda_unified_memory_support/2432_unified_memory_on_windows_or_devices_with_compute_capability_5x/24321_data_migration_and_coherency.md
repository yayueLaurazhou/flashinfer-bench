# 24.3.2.1. Data Migration and Coherency

#### 24.3.2.1. Data Migration and Coherency[](#data-migration-and-coherency "Permalink to this headline")

GPU architectures of compute capability lower than 6.0 do not support fine-grained movement of the managed data to GPU on-demand. Whenever a GPU kernel is launched all managed memory generally has to be transferred to GPU memory to avoid faulting on memory access. With compute capability 6.x a new GPU page faulting mechanism is introduced that provides more seamless Unified Memory functionality. Combined with the system-wide virtual address space, page faulting provides several benefits. First, page faulting means that the CUDA system software doesn’t need to synchronize all managed memory allocations to the GPU before each kernel launch. If a kernel running on the GPU accesses a page that is not resident in its memory, it faults, allowing the page to be automatically migrated to the GPU memory on-demand. Alternatively, the page may be mapped into the GPU address space for access over the PCIe or NVLink interconnects (mapping on access can sometimes be faster than migration). Note that Unified Memory is system-wide: GPUs (and CPUs) can fault on and migrate memory pages either from CPU memory or from the memory of other GPUs in the system.
