# __host__cudaError_t cudaGetDriverEntryPoint (const char *symbol, void **funcPtr, unsigned long long flags, cudaDriverEntryPointQueryResult *driverStatus)

Returns the requested driver API function pointer.

##### Parameters

**symbol**

  - The base name of the driver API function to look for. As an example, for the driver API
cuMemAlloc_v2, symbol would be cuMemAlloc. Note that the API will use the CUDA runtime
version to return the address to the most recent ABI compatible driver symbol, cuMemAlloc or
cuMemAlloc_v2.
**funcPtr**

  - Location to return the function pointer to the requested driver function
**flags**

  - Flags to specify search options.
**driverStatus**

  - Optional location to store the status of finding the symbol from the driver. See
cudaDriverEntryPointQueryResult for possible values.

##### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorNotSupported

##### Description

Deprecated This function is deprecated as of CUDA 13.0

Returns in **funcPtr the address of the CUDA driver function for the requested flags.

For a requested driver symbol, if the CUDA version in which the driver symbol was introduced
is less than or equal to the CUDA runtime version, the API will return the function pointer to the
corresponding versioned driver function.

The pointer returned by the API should be cast to a function pointer matching the requested driver
function's definition in the API header file. The function pointer typedef can be picked up from the
corresponding typedefs header file. For example, cudaTypedefs.h consists of function pointer typedefs
for driver APIs defined in cuda.h.

The API will return cudaSuccess and set the returned funcPtr if the requested driver function is valid
and supported on the platform.

The API will return cudaSuccess and set the returned funcPtr to NULL if the requested driver
function is not supported on the platform, no ABI compatible driver function exists for the CUDA
runtime version or if the driver symbol is invalid.

It will also set the optional driverStatus to one of the values in cudaDriverEntryPointQueryResult
with the following meanings:

cudaDriverEntryPointSuccess   - The requested symbol was succesfully found based on input

##### **‣**

arguments and pfn is valid
cudaDriverEntryPointSymbolNotFound  - The requested symbol was not found

##### **‣**

cudaDriverEntryPointVersionNotSufficent   - The requested symbol was found but is not supported

##### **‣**

by the current runtime version (CUDART_VERSION)

The requested flags can be:

cudaEnableDefault: This is the default mode. This is equivalent to

##### **‣**

cudaEnablePerThreadDefaultStream if the code is compiled with --default-stream per-thread
compilation flag or the macro CUDA_API_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM is defined;
cudaEnableLegacyStream otherwise.
cudaEnableLegacyStream: This will enable the search for all driver symbols that match the

##### **‣**

requested driver symbol name except the corresponding per-thread versions.
cudaEnablePerThreadDefaultStream: This will enable the search for all driver symbols that match

##### **‣**

the requested driver symbol name including the per-thread versions. If a per-thread version is not
found, the API will return the legacy version of the driver function.
